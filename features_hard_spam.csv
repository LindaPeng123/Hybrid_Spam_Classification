LEAD STORY

PHP FLAW COULD CRASH, BURN WEB SERVERS | News: SearchSecurity
A security vulnerability in the popular PHP scripting language could
allow an attacker to crash a Web server or run arbitrary code on a
system. Only particular versions of PHP are impacted, and users are
urged to upgrade or patch immediately.

THE MISSING LINK | Scot has cyber tomb with a view

Sometimes an epitaph just can't be the last word. Billy Kemp was a
great Scot who died a couple of years ago at the young age of 52. He
was a councilman, husband, father and pillar of his community. His
family couldn't possibly post all that on a tombstone. But they did
manage to fit http://www.billykemp.org.uk/ on there. Yep, Kemp's
tombstone doubles as a billboard for his Web site, created
posthumously by his son as a tribute to his father's life. The grave
site has gotten more than 33,000 hits, perhaps more visits than the
gravesite!

Techs lose again with Seibel earnings miss, AOL questions
Siebel Systems fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations and offered a worse-than-expected outlook, helping to depress technology shares Thursday.
Despite a forecast from IBM in line with analyst expectations, investors seemed more focused on reports of a possible management shake-up at AOL Time Warner and on a Washington Post story questioning accounting methods at America Online. CNET's Tech index shed 24.59 points, or 2.45 percent, to close at 982.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 40.30 points, or 2.88 percent, to close at 1,356.95.
Amid news The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators held steady in June, broader markts also headed south. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 133.0 points, or 1.56 percent, to close at 8,409.4. The S&P 500 slid 24.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 881.56--another multi-year low.
AOL used unconventional business practices-Post
America Online Inc. boosted its revenue figures through unconventional deals from 2000 to 2002, before and after its acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

A chart printed in conjunction with the Post article shows a total of $270.1 million in unconventional deals.
AOL TIME WARNER INC 12.45 -5.03%
IBM posts sharp drop in quarterly profits
International Business Machines Corp. on Wednesday said it eked out a second-quarter profit of just a few pennies a share as the world's largest computer maker took a $1.4 billion charge to exit money-losing businesses and cut jobs.

But even without the big charge, earnings at IBM, which sells everything from computer software to microchips to computer services, fell sharply as corporations concerned about their own bottom lines cut back on technology spending.
INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 72.05 1.92%
Nokia sees slight rise in Q3 handset sales vs Q2
Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia said on Thursday it expected a slight rise in handset unit sales for both itself and the industry in the third quarter versus the April-June period.

""it will be a reasonable quarter, but it will not represent such a dramatic growth as what might have been seen in some previous years,"" Chief Executive Jorma Ollila told a conference call following the firm's second-quarter result.

J.P. Morgan stays cautious toward Qwest in tech notes 7/18/02
Analyst Marc Crossman repeats a ""market performer"" rating on the telecom firm and further lowers his estimates on what he sees as continued deterioration of Qwest's local and long-distance businesses. Crossman says Qwest could violate a bank agreement by the end of this quarter if it doesn't close a significant asset sale. And he argues the firm faces a funding shortage next year that can't be satisfied by selling its eastern directories businesses alone.

Dell: PC Market Slow and May Stay So
The stumbling economy continues to dampen demand for personal computers and could do so for the rest of the year, Dell Computer Corp. Chief Operating Officer Kevin Rollins said on Thursday.

Despite the slow market, No. 2 computer maker Dell is gaining market share, partly because of the recent merger of Hewlett Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp., Rollins told reporters after Dell's annual shareholder meeting here.

1,text/html,None,25,1,0,0,com,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,1,"CNET: Copycat worms and a PGP Outlook flaw: 2.8.4-2
CNET Virus & Security Newsletter
July 17, 2002
--
Robert Vamosi
Senior Associate Editor
CNET Software and Internet Services
Dear Readers,
So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier
worms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security
news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect
Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.
Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password
An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with
a password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm
family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also
called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to
send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This
worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users
are not affected.
Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading
The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly
screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening
attached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also
known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of
a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully,
this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.
Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in
PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook
e-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail
program open to attack. Fortunately, there is a patch available.

Dear Reader,
Basic electronic organizers they're not, but if you're searching 
for a pocket-sized computer for music, movies, and games, then 
these PDAs are well worth a look. All four models feature fast 
processors, large amounts of RAM, and sharp, color screens, which 
make them better choices for rich media than competing products. 
But beyond those basics, these handhelds are very different. You'll 
find three different operating systems: Pocket PC, Palm, and Linux. 
Two have keyboards, one has a built-in Bluetooth radio, and all 
four support various expansion card formats. Most Pocket PCs are 
multimedia friendly; we've picked two that really stand out because 
of features or price. However, none of these are inexpensive models, 
so check out our hands-on reviews to find the high-end handheld 
that you'll be happiest with.

quite an attractive Palm OS PDA.

I'm not a banker, and I'm not a credit expert - but these people
speak from personal and professional experience. Draw your own
conclusions. Lockergnomie Sang Vo writes: ""Though you may have
zero liability for a fraudulent transaction, the paperwork and red
tape to work through if someone empties out all your funds can
leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards that
now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact
your credit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a
plan added to your card or if you can apply for one that does.""
And Russ Coover continues: ""If you purchase something with a
credit card, and you later decide to dispute the purchase (for a
reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses to
replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can
legally dispute the charge with your credit card company. However,
if you use a debit card to make that purchase, you have no right
to dispute the charge.""
Jeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in
question (E): ""In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if
you give your financial institution timely notice of the theft of
your card or PIN code (two business days), you are liable for no
more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up to $500."" And
Tim Miller extends the translation: ""If someone puts a false
charge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your
liability for $50, with the possibility that your next charge
might not go through because the thief used all of your available
balance.  If a false charge goes against your debit card and wipes
out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can bounce.
 Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the
payees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25
insufficient fund fees - and they are under no obligation to waive
those fees.  If you have  5 checks outstanding, you could be out
over $100.""
Frank Reyes was apparently lucky: ""Someone recently obtained my
debit card number through a local grocery store. I was told by the
checker at the grocery store that the card readers would only
accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was very suspicious, and used
my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's computer had been
hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several
others)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was
reviewing my checking account online two days later, and noticed
an unauthorized charge against my account ($60.00). I contacted
the vendor that had charged my account and informed them of the
fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the shipment, provided the
shipping address to my bank, and credited my account within 5 days
after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to
the 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact
that I had to request a new debit card, which has yet to arrive.""
Further thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: ""I'm not totally
sure on this, but I've been warned against using a debit card for
online purchases.  Yes, you may not be liable for any of the
false charges on a debit card (in the end), but in the meantime
(during your dispute) the money will be withheld from your account
and you will not have access to it. However with a credit card,
you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The
scenario I was given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your
debit card and cleaned out your checking account?  The money is
gone! False charges on a credit card are not ""real money"" until
somebody has to pay them.  I would guess that each bank has
different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call
mine and see what I'd face."" In short, be careful - no matter what
you use or where you choose to use your plastic.

Transloader
http://www.transloader.com/
""This site makes it easy to transfer files to your Web server.
Mostly it is useful for sites like FlamingText.com and
ImageBot.com to send generated images to another server (such as
your Web or FTP server). This is particularly useful for WebTV
users who can't save images on their own machine. Although we have
no pre-set limits (okay, it's 2.4 GB), the transfers that you do
through Transloader.com must be completed in five minutes. This
server is capable of transferring over 1 Gig per minute; if you
are talking to a slow server, your job may not complete in time.
Other transloaders sometimes suffer from overloading (too many
people using them), which is why I wrote this one. Hopefully, this
will never happen to us, but in any case, check these others out,
they have some nice services...""

Share or Not to Share
Scribbled by Lee Smith
I think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is
being shared. If the song is a current release or recent, then I
do not believe in it. I can't consider it stealing because you
can't steal from someone who willingly puts the file up for
downloading. Those who did put the file online most likely feel
that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.
However, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are
attempting to make their CDs ""rip proof"" either. I do not feel
they have the right to dictate what songs I can listen to or when
or in what order. I like to rip specific songs from CDs then make
my own CD, which either goes down to my entertainment system or to
my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played (""why"" is
explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for
my truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs
stolen, it would be much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a
master. Sometimes, masters cannot be replaced without a large
expense, if at all.
If the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not
available anywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song
being sought is wanted to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I
do believe in that, too. Case in point: as a kid, I collected a
lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than 4,000 records in my
collection. Many were played so much that they are not playable
anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap
stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to
relive some of my younger days through music, but attempting to
convert those records (to digital) is next to impossible for me.
So, in this instance, no, I do not think it is illegal to seek out
digitalized copies of the old songs that I already have records of
(albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I am seeking
are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD
from  wer Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer.
For those that are impossible to find ""digitals"" for, then, one
day, perhaps I will reach a point with technology (and money)
where I can transfer those platters to WAV and they will sound as
good as when they were originally recorded. I have been lucky
enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet; I was quick to
purchase the disc, usually from the original artists themselves.
Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I
blame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem
to care about the ""lost"" songs when digitally remastered CDs are
released.

you're thinking of getting a DV camera. I got one about a month
ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get one with A/V INPUTS.
Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your digital
stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to
get VHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only
can you get your old 8mm & VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can
use the camera as a pass-through device and get the old stuff
directly onto your computer for editing purposes. I wish someone
had made clear the advantages and importance of inputs when I
bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely
mentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But
if you're going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you
want to work on any of your old stuff). Don't make the same
mistake I did - make SURE you get this feature. It doesn't seem to
impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and some don't.""
This advice came not a moment too soon for me. Thank you for
helping us, Frank!

TROUBLESHOOTING VOICE | By  m Lancaster

When you're troubleshooting voice calls, particularly the signaling,
it's often helpful to look at the detailed output of the device, be
it a voice-enabled router, telephony server, gateway or whatever. 
This detailed output can be in the form of logs or debug output as is
the case in Cisco's IOS.  In any case, this output is likely to be
somewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often
uses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more
information on the screen using a short number than it is to write an
essay about why some event happened.

VoIP ENABLE YOUR TELEPHONY | By  m Lancaster

One of the reasons VoIP has been slowly gaining traction is that
large enterprises have quite a lot of legacy equipment, and migrating
to VoIP from the circuit-switched networks of yore is no easy feat.
These environments are typically complicated and the stakes are high
because so many mission-critical systems rely on telephony.

UNDERSTANDING RELAY | By  m Lancaster

Everyone knows that delay is one of the two primary causes of poor
voice quality, particularly in VoIP networks, but where does this
delay come from?  Delay is generally defined as the time it takes
from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that
sound is regenerated on the far end. Quite a few things have to
happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually
has many components.

CNET Software and Internet
Dear Readers,
If the best things in life are free, why does software cost so
much? Back in the day (that day being 1999, when the Internet was
the Next Big Thing), you could get almost all of your
software--e-mail, fax services, online desktops, you name it--for
free. Now, even
Yahoo
is charging for some of its formerly free mail services, including the ability to check your Yahoo mail from Outlook or another desktop e-mail client.
But if you look closely enough, you can still find some
worthwhile free apps. We've reviewed
four free e-mailers
to get you started. And we've also
taken a peek at the new
BearShare
, which is not only
free itself, but also lets you share music and media files at no
cost. Of course, whether you can find legal music to share is
another matter entirely.

Roundup: CNET reviews four free Web e-mailers
Yahoo now charges for services that were once free; Hotmail
   dumps accounts without so much as an explanation. So-called
   free Web-based e-mailers aren't quite as free-wheelin' as
   before. Are the savings worth the hassle? We take another
   look at so-called ""free"" e-mailers.
Get the gear you need to burn DVDs
DVD authoring is one of the hottest new hobbies around, but
   picking out the right equipment can be a daunting task.
   We've broken down the process and selected the best gear
   for the job, from camera to software, burner to DVD player.
BearShare 4.0
The latest version of this oft-overlooked Gnutella client
   lets you pay $19.95 for ad-free file sharing and offers a
   nice, clean interface and a chat client to boot. Plus,
   BearShare lets you opt out of bundled adware and spyware
   when you install it. Should you run to this app like a bear
   to honey? Not yet. We'll tell you why.

SBC Yahoo Dial
Thanks to a partnership with SBC Pacific Bell, Yahoo is now
   in the dial-up game. The new service, known as SBC Yahoo

   your SBC service package. Our reviewer investigates.

First Take: Winamp3 Release Candidate
We've been waiting aeons for the newest version of popular
   media player Winamp. We haven't received a full new version
   yet, but AOL has partially obliged with a prerelease
   version. Winamp3 Release Candidate serves up a new interface
   and some major underlying changes. But does the new look
   muddy up Winamp's legendary ease of use?

Based on your desription, we're guessing that QuickTime pops
   up when you try to stream a media file (video, audio, or MP3s)
   from the Web. If so, this probably means that you have
   QuickTime set as your default media player for all media
   files. And since your version of QuickTime is out-of-date,
   whenever it launches, it attmepts to upgrade. You could simply
   upgrade the program, or you can to turn off the autoupgrade
   feature. In QuickTime 5.0, open the program, select Edit >
   Preferences > QuickTime Preferences. Uncheck the box labeled
   ""Check for updates automatically.""
If, however, you simply prefer to use Windows Media Player,
   open that program, click  ols > Options. Select the Formats
   tab, then check the boxes next to all of the file types that
   you want Windows Media Player to open.   make sure that
   QuickTime doesn't override your WMP settings, uncheck those
   file types within QuickTime.

Oracle challenges Microsoft anew
Oracle is taking on Microsoft's Exchange with a
Collaboration Suite
that includes e-mail, calendar and messaging software. Oracle has pitched its products as Microsoft replacements before -- with spectacularly little success. (At Comdex last November, the database giant offered its 9i and app-server software as a more secure
alternative to Exchange
.) What's different this time? Oracle is selling a separate collaboration product that, says CEO
Larry Ellison
, is cheaper than rival offerings. Plus: Companies facing a deadline to join Redmond's new
licensing program

The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing 

ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his 
appearance in order to secure food 
more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he 
pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd 
by his costume. In the evening he was shut up by 
the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, 
and the entrance made thoroughly secure. But the 
shepherd, returning to the fold during the night 
to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly 
caught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and 
killed him instantly. 
Harm seek. harm find.

Techs fall with consumer sentiment
A drop in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index helped put a dent in technology shares Friday.
Despite Dell Computer raising its outlook and better-than-expected earnings from Juniper Networks, CNET's Tech index slipped 5.12 points, or 0.51 percent, to 990.0. The tech-packed Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.94 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,373.49.
Broader markets also fell, as investors shrugged off news of better-than-expected retail and food services sales in June. The Dow Jones industrials shed 117 points, or 1.33 percent, to 8,684.5--its fifth straight losing session. The S&P 500 lost 5.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 921.39.
Rivals help improve Dell's outlook
Dell Computer on Thursday raised its revenue and earnings outlook for the second quarter, saying it continues to gain market share from computer rivals.
The company said it now expects revenue for the quarter that ends Aug. 2 will reach $8.3 billion, up about 9 percent from last year's second quarter, with earnings of 19 cents per share. On May 16, the company predicted revenue would hit $8.2 billion and projected earnings at 18 cents per share.
DELL COMPUTER CORP 24.98 4.39%
Lukewarm response to Juniper moves
Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass.
Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive.
JUNIPER NETWORKS 7.70 6.65%
Asia proves sweet spot for Yahoo
Web portal Yahoo, which broke a long streak of losses in the second quarter, said it hopes to ride on Asia's acceptance of online advertising and focus on wireless content to boost its regional business.
""Asian advertisers who use traditional media like newspapers and TV are moving more into online ads as they see the value and efficiency that it delivers,"" Niren Hiro, Yahoo's general manager for Southeast Asia, said in an interview Thursday. ""That's why we've seen in the last quarter clients who have traditionally stayed away from new media like us starting to divert their budgets in our direction.""

J.P. Morgan downgrades Powerwave Technologies to ""long-term buy"" in tech notes 7/12/02
Analyst Ed Snyder lowers his rating from ""buy"" despite a strong quarter from the wireless communications gear maker. Powerwave has a diversified customer base and fewer competitors now, Snyder suggests. But he cuts his estimates and rating based on lower guidance from the company, weak third-generation (3G) wireless network orders, and likely cuts in carrier capital expenditures. The infrastructure market remains lumpy and hard to predict, Snyder says.

AOL on the hunt for new CEO
AOL Time Warner has begun casting a net for a chief executive for its beleaguered America Online division.
The move comes as no surprise. Former AOL CEO Barry Schuler stepped down from the position in April. But it raises questions about the future of Robert Pittman, AOL Time Warner's chief operating officer and the interim head of AOL. Pittman had been charged with fixing the division. As previously reported, sources in the company speculate that Pittman will not return to his duties as COO once he completes his stint at AOL.

Listen to Lockergnomie Dale Lowery and you'll save time
immediately. It's an old tip, but it bears repeating: ""I'll often
find Web snippets I'd like to keep - but I don't want to save the
entire page. So, I've HOT-KEYED Notepad. Easy! Get to the most
common Notepad shortcut icon: Start | Programs | Accessories |
Notepad. Then right-click on the menu item and select Properties.
You'll see that this is (indeed) a shortcut; in the lower part of
the dialog is a field to add a hotkey. I entered 'N' for Notepad,
Windows offered CTRL and ALT as a prefix, and now I can launch
Notepad in an instant. I highlight the text I want to keep, copy
it, tap my shortcut, paste it, and then save the new text file
wherever I want. Most often, I use this trick to copy paragraphs
that describe downloads (and save them as text files in the same
folder as the download)."" Just make sure you don't pick a keyboard
shortcut that's already in use. Otherwise, one of them is gonna
get cranky.
And while we're taking a trip down memory lane, Lockergnomie Ian
Rich reminds us of Jouni Vuorio's utility: The site is
jv16.org
. The program is called
jv16 Power  ols, and this freeware is truly worthy of praise. It
combines a full-on registry management tool with several file
manager tools: one to hunt down temporary files in any format and
the other to help perform advanced file searches and comparisons.
Mainly, I wanted the program to be brought to the attention of the
consumer public, as it moves further and further along in
development it just keeps getting better. I've used it on windows
Me, and now XP - without crashes or hair-raising Registry
corruption. It backs up everything it changes and is very easy to
use. If you're interested in something of shareware-quality with
forum support (for absolutely nothing), get this program. Anyway,
I love the newsletter and the work you guys and gals do at
Lockergnome. I hope that this author gets his recognition.""
Consider this a huge nod!
I love a good resource, and Lockergnomie Elton Jonsson from the
United Kingdom has one for us, too: ""As a dedicated subscriber, I
just had to tell about this one. Have you ever been driven mad
trying to find out the name of the piece of music on a television
advert? Well, at last, here in the UK, we have an answer to that
problem and, given that many multinationals use the same
advertising in the USA as they do here, it may help out you guys
as well. Check out
Commercial
Breaks and Beats
. I have no connection with it; I'm just
grateful that someone has had the brilliant idea of creating it.
If you check the message board on the site, you'll see that I'm
not alone."" This
Google
Directory
can help fill in the blanks, I'm sure. I
almost fell out of my chair the other day when I heard ""Yeh Yeh""
(by TMBG) being played on a Chrysler advertisement. Way to go:
John, John, Dan, Dan, and Dan! You're the dogs kids love to bite.
And what's say we round out the report with another tip?
Lockergnomie David Brown can oblige: ""The e-mail forwarding
service is a good idea, but you can do it yourself with Outlook
Express. Set up two accounts (one for your old account and one for
your new one). Craft your reply in a new message and save it.
Then, select  ols | Message Rules | Mail | New rule. Check 'Where
the message is from specified account' in the first section.
'Reply with message"" in section two. Select the appropriate
account and message in the final section. Name it. You can also
have the messages flagged or moved to another folder if you want
to know which messages came from the old account. Once the rule
has been created, any mail from the old account will have a reply
sent. People should learn about mail rules, anyway."" True! So,
what rule simplifies your day?
See You in
August

QuicKalendar v1.0.2 [430k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.trinfinitysoftware.com/quickalendar.shtml
{Calendar utility} You say you want to get together on the 25th, but what DAY is that? I'm not good with calendar dates; truth be told, I don't even know what day of the week it is most the time. If I didn't have my PDA armed with a Calendar with me, then I wouldn't show up to anything on time, let alone on the right day. Well, that is great for when I am mobile, but what about when I am in front of my PC? The PDA is docked, but that doesn't mean I have to be without a calendar... enter QuicKalendar! ""QuicKalendar gives you quick and easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. You can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments."" You need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. My suggestion is to play with the size of QuicKalendar's screen until you get a printout that you can be proud of. Now, you'll have no reason to be late for Gnomedex!
Diatris v1.0 [407k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.webruler.com/mtreciokas/
{Tetris-like game} I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes.   me everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! So it was no wonder why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-like games. ""For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games."" I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out!

How to Troubleshoot Issues with Reading CDs
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q321641
{Disc device troubleshooting} ""This article describes how you can troubleshoot issues reading CD-ROM or DVD-ROM optical discs. This article also discusses how to troubleshoot common issues with CD-R and CD-RW devices. The steps in this article apply to compact disc (CD-ROM) drives, compact disc recordable (CD-R) drives, compact disc re-writable (CD-RW) drives, and digital video disc (DVD) drives.""   summarize, you should try the steps on this site before calling your technical support. Some of the steps include closing unnecessary software, testing the disc in a different computer, and cleaning the disc. Make sure to clean a disc by wiping from the center of the disc outward... if you wipe the disc in a circular fashion, then you risk scratching it. The steps in this article will only serve to save you time, as you will probably be able to fix most disc problems by following the steps. If this article doesn't help you resolve your disc problem, look on the bright side... you won't have to spend so much time on the phone with technical support, because you'll already know what the problem ISN'T!

Modem Spy v3.1.3b [230k] W9x/2k/XP $25
Unearthed by Sergei Polishchuk
http://www.modemspy.com/
{Answering machine} ""Modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording. Features: 1) Records phone conversations. 2) Records from microphone. 3) Plays back recorded messages via phone line. 4) Plays back recorded messages via sound card. 5) Can record ALL incoming phone calls. 6) Has built-in software automatic gain control. 7) Detects and logs Caller ID."" Gnomie Brian Stevens tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his machines... he doesn't have any modems! Brian says, ""I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!"" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.

The Avocado Papers
Unearthed by Meryl Evans
http://www.theavocadopapers.com/
After surfing serious Web site upon serious Web site, you just need to find a site where you can relax and have a good time. TheAvocadoPapers.com is one of those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. It isn't that the Web site is really about anything; there is some creative writing (usually rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week ""Steve Schneider Interviews Himself""). If you are a little bit nosy, and want to peek into the lives of others, you can read Ron Bork's diary or enter the Avocado Chat. Although the makers of the Web site don't even know what it is about, I think it is quite apparent... fun! Go check out the Web site for yourself and see if you can pin down its rhyme or reason. Worst-case scenario, you can always sign up for their current promotion... free linguine!

GnomeTIP
This tip is for the Windows XP users out there. ""The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions.""   properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any ""idle tasks."" Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. ""All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time.   call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks."" Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.

This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori!
One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got 
even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows 
compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions 
came down in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional 
Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my 
opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great 
free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software 
player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?
At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true 
Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional 
functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's
XPlay
remains a 
better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an 
iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with 
contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the 
iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch 
Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.
Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's
SIC
without a hitch. I just missed a 
face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of
winferno.com
, although I'm sure 
we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the
free copy of Research-Desk
for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival, I enjoyed dinner with 
the
eSellerate
gang, with a 
discussion about
Gnome mes
and 
what the future holds.
Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately, my
Crosspaths.net
connection allows me 
to send mail via my Lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup 
services. Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of 
presence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, 
you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori 
has used their DSL service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of 
outstanding in dealing with customer service queries.

Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of

of shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, 
so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail 
price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. 
The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of 
paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 
50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains 
some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
(NR) 1966
Adapted Play - 131min
Reviewer's Tilt (10)
Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?""  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

Clearly you've never met ""Triumph"", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing
Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the
story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who
was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary
""discovered"" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car
a few years back.

I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
gonna be pretty.


Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple
of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed
Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.


Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their
activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too
much in the way of ""escaped"" ""revenue"", or at least the perception of
same in the local ""free"" press. Obviously, if your money ""there""
isn't exchangeable into your money ""here"", it kind of defeats the
purpose of keeping your money ""there"" in the first place, giving
folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line
credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or
quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and
the US.

As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom
on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually
accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
pretexts.

At this point, the ""legal"", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings
are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep
my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where
a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will
close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned
statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or
imagined property rights are this afternoon.


The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only
solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private
transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than ""transparent""
transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*
interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal
freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and
groom action figures sold separately, of course.

Cheers,
RAH
(Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.
Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and
I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better
in Anguilla, and the ""private"" banking system there is probably just
as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and
move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar
Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and
Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in
ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe
we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and
*Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger
things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?)

I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. 
Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers
volunteering
a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 




Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for
organizations
that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
seen some very interesting suggestions for
names
for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
through my email system.
It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
According to
this
article on
The Register
, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.
I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 




were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 




years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 




free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income
sources
.
On a brighter note, it looks like
Mandrake
has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the
Mandrake Linux User's
Club
.
The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with
Microtel
to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on
WalMart.com
.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
addition of both
Lindows
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.
Have a great Wednesday.

Checking Mail With KMail
I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from 

my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, 
procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.
There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
configuration issue.
force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in 

your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute 
window, change the command line to read:
kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %m
The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
you open the program.
Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?

Kernel Configuration - Part XIII
As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should 

come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
configuration is dense with details and options.
I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). 

Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.
For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and How s:
The Linux Security Quickstart How
covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel 
configuration issues
Linux Network Security from Linux Planet
a nice tutorial on network security
Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4
other approaches to network security
These should get you started.  morrow, we'll cover telephony support in your 
Linux kernel.

Linux PR
http://linuxpr.com/
If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for 
a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in 
the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very 
company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. 
Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on 
your favorite OS.

As if there weren't enough hypocrisy and misinformation 
being spewed by marketing and sales departments. This time, 
a
startling revelation
that Microsoft refuses 
to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the 
very things the product is meant to stop - worms and 
intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and 
they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to 
cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to 
say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying 
desktops based on AMD processors!
Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a 
software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely 
blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise 
decision, in fact - admit defeat and move on. However, why 
is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point 
that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first 
place? After all, patches were released months ago, so IIS 
is impervious to attack now. Still considering the 
deployment of IIS as your web server platform of choice? 
Things that make you go hmmmm...
See You in

SQL Server Install Leaves Passwords Behind
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-035.asp
During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, 
various bits of configuration information are stored in a 
setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been 
captured in order to configure the services. Prior to 
certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear 
text, which is problematic because the file is left on the 
hard drive after the installation process is completed. 
Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned 
up any relevant bits and pieces applicable to your 
environment.
SQL Server Cumulative Patch
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-034.asp
A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes 
care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new 
items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could 
allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a 
different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to 
improper permissions within the registry. All three are 
spackled over by the latest cumulative patch described 
further in this bulletin.

Win2K Memory Allocation Adjustments
Unearthed by Wayne Clark
http://searchwin2000.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid1_gci835208,00.html
Most Windows 2000 servers tune themselves fairly well and 
do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to 
just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a 
problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent 
explanation of one particular situation where memory pools 
can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving 
into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be 
certain you know what you're messing with or you could just 
make things worse. Backups, backups, backups.

Sorting IP Addresses Via Script
http://www.i386.com/Default.asp?page=docs/scripting-ip2long.htm&category=admin&id=1046
Documentation is everything. If you have a handle on your 
network configuration, it's much easier to manage. IP 
addresses are one bit of information that must be properly 
tracked, but often it's a manual effort to enter and sort 
data. Using the script techniques provided in this brief 
article, you can convert an address to a 32-bit number, 
perform the sort, then convert back to the standard dotted 
decimal format. An Excel sample spreadsheet is also provided 
to get you started.

Broadband Sharing Crackdown
http://news.com.com/2100-1033-942323.html
Those of us with wireless networking equipment might be 
tempted to allow the neighbors to share the wealth, but be 
careful. Broadband companies are catching on and putting a 
stop to the practice. What's concerning to me is that I 
don't share my wireless network, but I do use quite a few 
different machines at any given time. If someone is snooping 
around and seeing a lot of different sessions and gets 
curious, might I be subject to a teeth-kicking?

down, check back later. Using a web form, you can enter the 
moves you'd like to see represented on the pad, which is 
viewed through a live webcam. I'd love to see someone craft 
the Lockergnome logo. Impress me...

The tech side of homeland defense
Computer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President Bush's proposal for a Department of Homeland Security, as politicians fret about tech-savvy terrorists--and insist that any new agency must shield the United States from electronic attacks. Meanwhile, the administration says that it's open to the idea of a chief privacy officer for the agency.

Studios sue defunct $1 movie site
The movie studio's trade association filed suit Tuesday against Film88.com, a would-be Internet video Web site that has allegedly popped up in several incarnations around the world.
Calling the site a ""piratical, virtual 'video-on-demand' business,"" the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and its member studios sued the company and an individual allegedly associated with it in a California federal court.

$215 million later, start-up Pluris shuts down
Networking start-up Pluris will release a statement Wednesday announcing it has closed its doors due to a lack of funding and ongoing woes in the market it serves, according to a spokeswoman familiar with the company's plans.
Pluris, a once promising company, burned through $215 million over the past few years as it attempted to build a high-end router that was intended to outclass similar products from competitors such as Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems.

Apple to expand iMac LCD display
Apple Computer plans to serve up a new iMac model with a larger flat-panel display during next week's Macworld Expo trade show, according to sources.
The upgrade to a 17-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) comes as sales have all but stalled on existing 15-inch flat-panel iMacs. Apple unveiled the original flat-panel iMac, which suspends the monitor from a pivoting arm attached to a hemispherical base, during January's Macworld Expo in San Francisco.

NextCard cuts off credit card customers
Federal regulators on Wednesday deactivated hundreds of thousands of credit cards belonging to former customers of NextCard.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which had been trying unsuccessfully to sell the 800,000 accounts since taking them over in February, shut them down after they failed certain performance measures over the past three months, said David Barr, an FDIC spokesman. Although NextCard customers will no longer be able to use their cards to make purchase or cash withdrawals, they will continue to be responsible for their outstanding balances.

Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a Gnome me for all 
you
Dreamweaver users
out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK 
with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list 
of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) 
easier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 
until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX  suite, but 
I've been  able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, 
so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to
check 'em out too
.
As I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently 
switched cell phones to the
Kyocera QCP6035
. 
The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the 
functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles 
you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly 
cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can 
already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like 
driving directions.
Now that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a 
more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. 
I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to 
be at least  a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences 
in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.

phpMyNewsletter
http://gregory.kokanosky.free.fr/phpmynewsletter/
As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, 
this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a 
mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation 
e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to 
the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a 
confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want 
to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, 
following an administrator defined waiting period.
  the php 
interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, 
with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. 
Documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and 
mySQL are useful in getting this installed.

OpalisRobot v4.0 [60MB] NT/W2k/XP
http://www.opalis.com
Think of this as something like ""cron for Windows"" only even more powerful. 
OpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, 
adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program 
telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot 
effectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, 
making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, 
even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming 
jobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks 
to save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're 
adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars 
by not having this software.

PNG Files Do Not Show Transparency in Internet Explorer (Q294714)
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q294714
""If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent

may appear to be gray rather than transparent.""

Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I 
haven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you 
simplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution.

GnomeUSABILITY
http://diveintomark.org/
Not only is this information great for improving blog accessibility, it 
happens to be equally relevant for *any* site. The 30 days are nearing 
their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; 
you can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, 
sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent 
real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological 
limitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through 
an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back 
specific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are 
presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll 
be able to make every site you design more user friendly.
GnomeBLOG
Backend.UserLand.Com
http://backend.userland.com/
I've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating 
a blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates 
itself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a 
desktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully 
documented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to 
their network, which could easily be adapted to other content 
management applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to 
look ""under the hood"" at Userland's XML inner workings, including 
detailed documentation on making everything work. If you've got 
modifications or improvements to the system, they have an open 
discussion forum for trading ideas.

weighed in this week, arguing that piracy over P2P networks robs songwriters on a massive scale. The congressman from Hollywood has authored a bill to stop illegal digital downloads by giving copyright owners the ability to technologically impair the distribution of copyrighted works.

Spotting a scam in sheep's clothing
Berman's proposal received a cool reception in Silicon Valley, where rules are frowned upon and unfettered innovation reigns supreme. So it was that StreamCast CEO
Steve Griffin
spoke for many in the community when he wrote that Berman's proposal won't work. What's more, he wondered, was Berman really concerned about controlling piracy, or could the congressman from Hollywood be influenced by certain constituents? Conspiracy buffs this week had a field day.

How to curb digital piracy
The odds that either side will raise the white flag are slim. But must this debate necessarily turn into an endless donnybrook? Former White House staffer
Jonathan Greenblatt
doesn't buy into historical determinism, and believes Hollywood can respond to the challenge of new media. First, it must shy away from any legislation that aims to control technology or enforces any ""draconian"" digital rights management rules. What other suggestions does he offer? Read on.

Writing file sharing's final chapter
All this occurs as the P2P community lost one of its brighter lights. Computer scientist and entrepreneur
Gene Kan
died June 29. Kan, who helped to develop an early open-source version of Gnutella software, wrote a column for CNET News.com on June 21, drawing on the lessons learned from the history of peer-to-peer technology. In this highly nuanced piece, Kan offers a timely warning about what can happen when people get overly excited about new technologies.

CEOs: Are you too focused?
Conventional wisdom has it that ""focus"" is de rigueur for any corporation hoping to achieve superior performance. The flip side of this argument is that markets are quick to discount the valuations of diversified companies because of perceived shortcomings. But researchers at McKinsey offer an alternative idea, suggesting that there's a particularly fertile middle ground between focus and diversification.

Dear Fool,

Just before Enron plunged...

...16 of 17 Wall Street analysts were still urging you 
to buy Enron's stock.  While the company piled up debt 
and manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the 
balance sheet a big thumbs-up.  As investors lost 
everything, Enron insiders pocketed millions.

AND THAT should make every investor's blood boil!

Frankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world 
infuriate me.  All the backroom manipulations dirty 
dealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who 
you can trust.   And that is why we've created a NEW 
investing service, ""David &  m Gardner's Motley Fool 
Stock Advisor"" -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders' 
extraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis, 
fair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like 
you on a regular and timely basis.

The Motley Fool, which David and  m founded back in 
1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the 
right tools...the average guy can find great success in 
every aspect of his financial life.

And now, David and  m are applying this principle -- and 
their extensive investing experience -- to the new 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor.""  

But as you'll see, this service isn't just about 
""buying more stocks.""  OUR GOAL in publishing the 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" is twofold:    help you 
gain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make 
money in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the 
biggest mistakes, as well.

The Wall Street analysts touting Global Crossing said 
its worldwide fiber-optics network would make it the 
king of telecom.  Now these shares are WORTH NOTHING.  
Microstrategy was the poster child of the technology 
bubble-after earnings restatements, the stock now sits 
99% OFF its high!  Kmart's lousy inventory management 
and marketing incompetence helped drive the company 
into BANKRUPTCY.

WHAT ABOUT Nortel and Lucent-two of America's most 
widely owned stocks.  Will they ever come back?  How 
about AOL?  Does its merger with Time-Warner mean the 
GLORY DAYS are over -- or have they just begun?   Are 90% 
of all telecommunications companies truly in danger of 
disappearing? If so, which will survive? Will great 
old names like JP Morgan, Disney and Motorola recover?  

Well, those are the sorts of questions David &  m 
Gardner can help you answer at the ""Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor.""  

As they say, ""Show us the money.""  When it comes to 
making promises, fast-talkers can fudge just about 
anything.  But CASH FLOW doesn't lie.

YOU CAN avoid a lot of big mistakes by simply making 
sure a company has the cash coming in to pay its 
bills.  And watching cash flow is also one of the best 
ways to identify superstar companies -- far more reliable 
than ""earnings"" that can be manipulated 8 ways to 
Sunday.  Once you eliminate big losers from the 
equation -- and target the true superstars -- you'll find 
investing more fun...less stressful...and much more 
profitable, as well.

So forget about Wall Street's ""damaged goods""-
companies that have a boatload of debt and accounting 
woes, as well.  Keep it SIMPLE instead.

""Simple"" means investing in companies that we all -- with 
a little effort -- can understand.  Companies where we 
know what businesses they're really in.  Companies 
where the financial statements actually mean 
something.  And companies easily recognizable as the 
""best of breed.""

In the free report you received, ""The One Stock That 
Keeps Wall Street BUZZING,"" you read about one of 
David &  m's very favorite investments: Starbucks.  
Before this company came along, most folks just took 
coffee for granted.  And certainly, no one proposed 
any far-reaching business model built around it.  Yet 
these innovators took a low-margin commodity and built 
a near $3 BILLION company with more than 5000 
retail outfits all around the world.

Starbucks has been able to open new outlets based on 
money it has earned from existing ones. That is an 
astounding testament to its economic power.  At The 
Motley Fool Stock Advisor we'll help you find and 
truly understand the great investments, the companies 
with solid balance sheets and real growth prospects.   
Right now we're following companies such as:

*America's most prestigious jeweler -- its brand name 
has no rival.  With net margins of 59% on sales of 
$1.6 Billion, this company is a great pick for solid 
returns with low risk.   

*This software company commands more than 25% of the 
video game market.  Its shares have returned 6,000% 
since its public debut in 1989.  An investment of 
$5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000.  The video 
game market is expected to double by 2005 with this 
company enjoying the lion's share of the growth.

*This premier credit rating company has locked-in 
demand for its reports on the creditworthiness of 
borrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt.  
It has a 20-year record of consistent sales and income 
growth and is poised for another stellar year.

YOU CAN TRY the ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" for six 
full months 100% RISK-FREE.  If we don't prove its 
worth to you, it doesn't cost you a dime.

As a Charter Subscriber, you get the ""Motley Fool 
Stock Advisor"" delivered to your home each month; a

take full advantage of breaking news; full use of the 
Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber-only Web site,

http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=1UE733

Sincerely yours,

Mike Bell, Publisher
""David &  m Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor""

P.S. Do you like BIG PROFITS?  In 1994, investment 
pros sniffed at America Online's high-flying stock and 
screamed, ""Overvalued.""  But the Gardners saw three 
things they overlooked: 1) AOL was building the 
premier stop in cyberspace; 2) They had a great 
retention strategy; and 3) Millions of members paying 
$$$ every month.

So  m and David bought it.  And today they're sitting 
on whopping 4,120% gains.  So you see, while they do 
structure their investing strategy to avoid big 
blunders...they do make a lot of money, too.    try the 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" RISK-FREE, click here now:

Whether you are looking for your
dream job

hire talented people
,
the full-featured career resource center is the place to start. Find your
IT talent solution
today!
I've just got a few quick thoughts today.
First, the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday's Penguin Shell. The response has been great, with more than two dozen offers of web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. It gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause. Know that whether you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the outcome.
Second, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, ""Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement."" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on.
On to some Lockergnome news. If you haven't already heard,
CleverMedia
is sponsoring karaoke night at
Gnomedex
. According to the woman with her finger on the pulse of Gnomedex, Lori Lockwood, ""There is definitely a 'surprise' in the works for the attendees ... "" Hmmm. Could it even compare to last year's Miss Gnomedex contest? I think it unlikely. In any regard, the folks at CleverMedia are certainly more than capable of coming up with loads of fun -- it's what they do for a living! Between

Windows Apps in Linux? - Part II
I don't want to mince any words, here.
CodeWeavers
has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released
CrossOver Office
product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the
Wine Project
. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.
Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and
CrossOver Plugin
(as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.
I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.
Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.
For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer"" driver.
Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.
A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.

GnomeCORE
Kernel Configuration - Part X
day we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration.
There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, ""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.
See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.
morrow, we
will
dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device kernel configuration.

CHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS:
If you've got friends or family who want to learn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check out the VHS release of
Computer Basics
in the GnomeStore. Chris teams with TechTV cohort, Kate Botello, to lead novices on a journey through their computer.
  basic interactions, to installing apps, to using the Internet and e-mail, Chris and Kate have all the basics covered. Help out a friend and
get them a copy
today.
Wednesday's trip went fairly smooth overall, and I actually 
enjoyed helping out my friend Larry with some server 
software installation and network configuration tasks. His 
kids seemed impressed with the new ability to copy files 
between the five different computers and have Internet 
access at any of them. Ahh, yes... geeks in the making.
After that project was finished, I met up with Jake at a 
nearby Starbucks to shoot the breeze and catch up on all 
things Lockergnome. We email all the time, but it's nice to 
have a face-to-face conversation for a change. He had just 
finished establishing new phone service with Verizon, so he 
has a fun new PalmOS-based phone to play with.
After the dose of caffeine, I headed up to Boone, Iowa to 
hook up with my cousin Casey and his wife of two months, 
Stephanie. Their new house is awesome, but disappointing, as 
there was no high-speed Internet connection or wireless 
networking. We'll have to fix that. For now, I'll remain 
impressed with the geothermal heating/cooling system and the 
vast potential of the unfinished basement that will someday 
make an incredible rec room [insert suitable Tim Allen grunt 
here].
Casey is ticked about all of the rain recently because it 
keeps eroding his dirt front yard into the drainage ditch. 
The back yard is in great shape, as there was sod laid after 
construction finished up, but he decided to save a few bucks 
and seed the front himself next spring. This now assumes 
that he'll have a front yard left by then.
The rain turned out to be the last event of the evening. 
I drove through the beginning of the storms on the way from 
Ankeny to Boone, and I just knew it was going to be a rough 
drive home later since they were only getting started at 
that time. I was correct. What would normally be an hour and 
45 minute drive turned into nearly two and a half hours and 
many, many animal sightings. As the night wore on, I was 
half expecting to see someone building an ark in a 
cornfield. Must have been where the animals were headed.
The rain guage at home showed 3.25"" this morning, adding 
to the 1.25"" and 2.5"" amounts dumped out of it within the 
last week. I considered setting the sprinkler up in the 
front yard today as an attempt at neighborly humor, but 
figured I'd just be labeled as a complete moron instead.
So, what did I forget to take with me, you ask? 
Directions to Larry's house. DOH! I had to dig out the 
notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly 
memorize the route. Instead, I decided to transcribe the 
list on my Jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to 
read as I navigated through the streets. There's still a use 
for printers in this world, without question. Reading text 
from the tiny screen bites. Larger print and bold text on a 
sheet of paper is the way to go. At least I didn't leave my 
PDA at home as well, which I actually considered doing.
See You in

Satellite Internet Delays Add Up
http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm
Have you considered moving to a satellite Internet 
provider at some point? While all of the marketing hype 
paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you 
really must consider before writing the check. The birds are 
some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there 
is a significant delay while the bits float up and back 
down. The absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one 
place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. Add in 
hops across the Internet and other hardware latency and it's 
common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 
milliseconds - an eternity when you're talking about TCP/IP 
connections. Now consider how VPN connections are affected, 
being that they are generally significantly slower on the 
ground without the extra 46,000 miles. Ouch! This white 
paper is a tad marketing driven, but I think their 
explanation of technology and how they are addressing VPN-
over-satellite connections is quite informative.

PGP Outlook Plug-in Vulnerability

Even encryption software is potentially exposed to 
security problems. Network Associates' PGP software, which 
interfaces directly with Microsoft Outlook, has been found 
to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. Exposed 
systems can be made to execute code of the attacker's 
choice, and because email can be sent from anywhere and to 
anywhere. Tracking down the source could be rather 
difficult. Hotfixes for each of NAI's products are available

Intro to Relational Databases
http://www.15seconds.com/issue/020522.htm
You know what a database is, right? Sure you do. Can you 
explain what a relational database is all about? Correctly? 
There's a lot more to database management and development 
than dumping a bunch of records into tables and generating 
reports. Proper design is crucial. Trust me. I've been on 
the receiving end of some lazy programming efforts that 
ignore the foundation of relational databases, and it 
usually results in additional work later.

Smile While You Surf
I like creative use of 404 pages, so sue me. Some of you have complained about the one Chris created for display when you come across a bogus link on the Lockergnome web site, which I don't understand. Would you rather stare at that stupid-looking, uninformative and generally useless one that your browser provides by default?
Cramsession.com posted some unique ""excuses"" for their site being down for maintenance, and I thought I'd share a few:
Roses are red
Our web site is resting
We're fixing the server
While Everquesting
In the interest of research, we're testing to see how long it takes a Network Administrator to get through a people-size maze to the web servers. As soon as he finds them, we'll be back online... Unless the Marketing Minotaur gets him first.
Suicide note found on the web server: ""I've had it. I can't take the heat anymore. You ran me ragged, and what thanks did I get? None. Null. Nothing. I gave and I gave, and you still wanted more I spent every second of my day trying to make you happy, but it was never enough. Always work faster, do more, stay late, work overtime, be more efficient. I was never good enough for you anyway. You deserve better. Signed CPU.""
You have reached the Cramsession Maintenance Page.
While you are staring at this page, waiting for the website to come back up, (should take about an hour or two) We'd like to offer the following fun activities:
Hold your breath until you see black spots dancing in front of your eyes.
Spin around in your chair until you get nauseous. Wheee!
Pretend your mouse is a microphone. Dictate a memo into it where you outline your plans for global domination.
Connect the dots!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .
Get monitor cleaner so you can wipe ink off of screen from connecting the dots.
We apologise for the inconvenience of our missing web site. We're doing something really ""high tech"" and ""important"" behind this ""maintenance"" curtain. We'll be back just as soon as we catch all the gophers.....Again.
HELP! I'm locked in the Server Room. Please send Help! And I'm running out of potato chips, too!

Date: Tue, 8 Oct 2002 17:54:52 -0500


    Cliped from the latest CERT.org warning list:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""I. Description

   The  CERT/CC  has received confirmation that some copies of the source
   code  for  the  Sendmail  package have been modified by an intruder to
   contain a Trojan horse.

   The following files were modified to include the malicious code:

     sendmail.8.12.6.tar.Z
     sendmail.8.12.6.tar.gz

   These  files  began  to  appear  in  downloads  from  the  FTP  server
   ftp.sendmail.org  on  or  around  September  28,  2002.  The  Sendmail
   development  team  disabled  the  compromised FTP server on October 6,
   2002  at  approximately  22:15  PDT.  It  does  not appear that copies
   downloaded  via  HTTP contained the Trojan horse; however, the CERT/CC
   encourages  users  who  may  have  downloaded the source code via HTTP
   during  this  time  period  to take the steps outlined in the Solution
   section as a precautionary measure.""

     OK, it's now time to work out the PGP securing of apt repository traffic. I've never gotten anything but ""sitename.whatever will not be authenticated"" until running Redhat 8.0 when I get something about having ""No Key"" for various files.

    What's it take to ensure we're covered against this kind of childish/moronic/Microsoft-era problems?

Make Internet Explorer Faster, More Capable, and Secure! 
NNT's reviewers called Secure IE great, easy-to-use,awesome,
impressive, a total ""thumbs up""!  Read what they're raving 
about and get yours at http://www.secureie.com/p/nnt1/
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

01. READERS WRITE.  A Wisconsin subscriber wrote to express his displeasure 
with the links contained in Neat Net Tricks.  It seems he is bothered by 
the frequent pop-up ads and he felt that only those sites without the ads 
should be featured in NNT, particularly in the Premium issue. We replied 
that pop-ups can be annoying but, while not defending them, we must realize 
that they are a form of marketing in which the site owner hopes to recover 
his costs and possibly make a profit.  We suggested using a pop-up stopper 
(there are lots of them on the Web) and ALT F4 will quickly close active 
pop-up windows.  Finally, we pointed out that no publication can guarantee 
only sites without pop-up ads.  As we've often said in the past, the 
Internet isn't free and never was.  Someone has to pay the freight and if 
those ads are unprofitable, they will cease to exist.

02. EXTENSION SEARCH.  Next time a file extension has you puzzled, try the 
database at http://extsearch.com/ information.

03. DUMB MESSAGES REVISITED.  Not long ago we mentioned a few dumb messages 
we see from our computer and invited others to share their favorite 
""dumbness.""  A reader frequently gets a banner ad that asks ""Do you click 
on banner ads.""  She asks, if you don't, how do you click ""No"" without 
clicking on the banner ad? Others galled at their computers crashing, then 
sitting through the Scandisk operation and being reminded ""  avoid seeing 
this screen again, always shut down Windows properly"" as if it was their 
fault. Another reader nominates the download site at 
http://www.microsoft.com/NTWorkstation/downloads/Power ys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp 
for having a really dumb comment.  After downloading a Windows update, it 
says:  ""How to Get Started -- You don't need to do anything after 
downloading"" and he asks, ""what's the point of downloading?""  Still another 
reader nominates the instruction manual for the Windows Internet 
Information Server (ILS) accessible only when ILS is operating.  Thus, the 
entire section on troubleshooting a nonfunctional installation is 
inaccessible at precisely the moment one needs to consult it.  But judging 
by the sheer quantity of email, the top dumb instruction has to be the 
message that ""Keyboard not detected, Press (whatever key) to 
Continue.""  Keep them coming and we'll do it again in a future issue!

04. XP TWEAK.  A recent article reminded readers of the neat things that 
can be done with TweakUI, but the XP operating system was not supported by 
the Tweak at that link.  Never fear, XP folks, you'll find a whole array of 
power tools included Tweak - all for XP - at 
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp .

. . . . .

1, 400+ Neat Net Tricks tips updated 4 times yearly for the word processing 
format of your choice, also in ebook format, plus extra features, 
downloadable and just $20 a year, a bargain (and a nice stocking stuffer 
for Santa) at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store.

. . . . .

05. HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS TOOL.  Windows98 users have a neat tool at their 
fingertips without downloading.  Click on Start and Run and enter ""hwinfo 
/ui"" without quotes.  The information displayed is color-coded.  Error 
messages are in red, warnings are in blue.  Green denotes registry entries, 
Configuration Manager information is in brown and file attributes are shown 
in magenta.

06. TRAINING WINDOWS.  One pet peeve is Windows' determination to identify 
a shortcut icon as ""Shortcut to (whatever)""  This is pure redundancy, since 
shortcuts are identified by an arrow.  And, with the added verbage of 
""Short cut to"" you can't jump from one icon to another by pressing the 
first letter (since they would all start with an ""s"".  If you keep removing 
""Shortcut to,"" Windows will eventually understand your intent and future 
shortcuts won't include ""Shortcut to"".

07. HOLD THAT BUTTON.  The site at http://www.holdthebutton.com/ invites 
you to hold the mouse key down.  Now, before you hastily jump to 
conclusions that there's nothing more to this site, when you release the 
button, you are told how you rank in stamina with other button 
holders.  And when I took my turn at the controls, I found that the longest 
record was a little over six hours, proving once again that some folks need 
to get a life.

08. HAGAI'S FREEWARE.  A baker's dozen (13) freeware programs are at 
http://www.hagai.com/download.asp?ProgType=Freeware . They include a bug 
checker, screen saver loader, clock, shutdown utility, CD autorun, boot 
editor, menu, counter,icon viewer and editor, and more.

09. ONLINE HELP.  Of limited scope, but considering that you can never get 
enough help with your computer, try http://www.computerhope.com/oh.htm .

. . . . .

Apologies to those readers who were inconvenienced with multiple issues of 
NNT Issue #137.  As luck would have it, Lyris (our mail server) had 
hardware failure causing some of the repeated distribution. We'd like to 
tell you that there will never be another problem in future mailings, and 
if you'll buy that, as the song goes, we have some oceanfront property in 
Arizona for sale.

My gut reaction would be to tell them to go and shite, but this might not help to solve the problem. People who do horsey gigs get insurance because they can prove that they are 'expert'. They can then get a quote. What about finding out what they are prepared to insure, and then tell them that you are pulling in your horns and will do what you are insured to do, and make sure no one chops up any one else.
Best of luck

Dear Readers,
=09=09=09
Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs
doing
something about it
. And what
about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?
Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru,
show you how
.

This week in Internet Services
Big broadband providers are ticked off about Wi-Fi hot spots.
In fact, both AT&T Broadband and Time Warner Cable have begun
campaigns to stop subscribers from sharing their accounts with
others at no charge. Also this week: we review Yahoo""s new
dial-up service.
Is your ISP safe from hackers?
Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard
about security issues, but should you count on their skills to
ward off intruders? Not wise, says our ISP expert. In this
week""s column, Dan Tynan takes security matters into his own
hands and shows you how to protect yourself.
Domain names
A domain name provides an online identity and contact point for
your business, organization, or project. Almost every transaction
on the Internet relies upon a domain name to conduct commerce,
display Web pages, deliver e-mail, and more. Secure your own
domain here.
Comcast shareholders bless AT&T deal
Comcast shareholders on Wednesday approved the cable television
company's $27 billion purchase of larger rival AT&T Broadband,
which will create the nation's largest cable TV operator with
more than 22 million customers.
U.S. Attorney investigates Qwest=20
Qwest Communications International, the number-four U.S. local
telephone carrier, said Wednesday that the U.S. Attorney's office
in Denver has begun a criminal investigation of the company.

1,text/plain,None,0,0,0,0,com,0,0,0,6,0,2,1,1,"a deadlock problem: NotJunk

Hi XFS developers,
When studying xfs code(2.4.19), I found that the inode will be locked by 
XFS_ILOCK_SHARE flags before we get acl, which may cause deadlock.
Because when getting acl, it will allocate memory in KM_SLEEP, If the 
memory is tight, the process will call xfs_strategy, and may 
lock(XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)the same inode again. If between these two locks, 
another process try to lock the inode by XFS_ILOCK_EXCL, these two 
processes  will be deadlock. As follows,

    A process get ea                         B process want lock ipA

1) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)             .....................
            |                                         |
            |                                         |
         get acl                        2) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL)
            |                                         |
            |                                         |
        memory tight
            |
            |
        xfs_stragegy
            |
            |
3)xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)        ............................

  these two processes will be dead lock.

So I believe that acl allocation GFP_MASKshould be changed to KM_NOFS.
right?

SEC EXPOSES BIG BLUE'S PINK SLIPS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Does the Securities and Exchange Commission have a press pass
yet? It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day
of the deadline for companies to certify their financial
statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited
for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words
tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave 
the commission its latest layoff numbers.

IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings
report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope.
(""Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way..."") Only after
""months of surreptitious layoff notices"" did the company admit
that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's
about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. 
An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher
number was due to ""rebalancing"" and more employees than expected 
taking voluntary layoffs. 

Sorry, we're still back on ""rebalancing."" Did IBM ""rightsize""
last quarter, too?

IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some
details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's
microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT
services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees 
from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.)
Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such
as Austin and Raleigh. 

OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're
still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so
bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting
regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for ""stealth
layoffs,"" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced
it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the
latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give
specifics. Yeesh. - Jen Muehlbauer

SYNERGY AND BETRAYAL AT VIVENDI
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Synergy always was a fuzzy concept. Now Vivendi Universal's top
man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced
today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle 
up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book
publisher Houghton Mifflin. 

It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine
turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply
following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe
$18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian
reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when
investors got the willies about the company's impending
announcement on its financial health. But the company had
positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first 
half was up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7%
boost. 

Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring
efforts, with more information expected at the next board
meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton
Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague
explanation that included the ""Curious George"" character, were
the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian
speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games
business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone
company SFR, a debatable sale because of the cash it generates,
according to the newspaper. 

Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues
to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources
say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough
to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan
abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an
unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the
Mediterranean. The working title? ""How I Was Betrayed.""  -

My mom just notified me of my aunt Theresa's death. She was my
father's older sister, though I only knew her through a few e-mail
exchanges and a couple of brief encounters as a child. This news
came hours after I received ANOTHER bit of disturbing news:
""Please tell Chris that one of his first fans died last weekend of
a heart attack at home."" I first met Jon Snyder at an Apple user's
group meeting a couple of years ago; to me, he always looked like
a beefier Robert Beltran. Death is something we all must deal
with, but you never seem to be prepared for it when someone
actually dies. A few months ago, Aunt Theresa sent word that she
had seen my show. It was good to know that even though we hadn't
interacted much over the past few years, she was still able to see
me on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to
Jon than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a
few months ago:
""I evangelized for months last year for having our company at
the first of these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines
last October, but got shot down. The conference was a hit despite
being postponed by 9/11, and having to move the venue at the last
minute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all over again
being 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this
year. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email
publishing group 'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a
friend of mine. He was the 'kid' hired by TechTV to host their
Call for Help daily TV program in SF starting last fall. If you
get the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can catch his show. I
have my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily basis.
It's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole.""
I returned from speaking to another
user group
the other night and
found that approximately 100 new Gnome mes had been ordered.
Sweet! When I started looking closer at the numbers, I realized
that Jake was offering his
Converting
Vinyl LPs to CD
eBook for free - and that's all anybody was
taking. No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them
were just for that particular title. Now, while I don't have a
problem with Jake's offer, I do want to encourage you to check out
the non-free titles (and if you've already looked, please
look again
). A lot of blood,
sweat, and tears went into them - and they're just as helpful. In
fact, Jake's also written one for
OS X
(which
probably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple
machine). Although, I'm sure plenty of you use
Dreamweaver
.
Which reminds me: Jake's also now authoring our Webmaster Weekly
newsletter. So, if you haven't read that in a while, I'd encourage
you to give it another glance. After all, as
Elwood
Edwards
so finely said:

The Evidence is Against You
Scribbled by Jim Girard
Every time some new technology has expanded free access to popular
music, starting with radio broadcasts of recorded songs in the
1930s, the recording industry has fought it - claiming that it
would cost them money. And every time, it has resulted in
increased sales. The best-known example, of course, was the
advances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including
Dolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed
by the music industry as different from previous such
developments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to
create their own copies at near-professional quality. The actual
result was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music
industry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became
more popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD
technology).
The thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect -
 and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of
songs in MP3 format. If that were their goal, they'd be
instituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the
server-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations
playing their music in the 30s, when they really thought the
phenomenon was going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused
on the best-known services - first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA,
and most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in those cases, they've
limited their legal challenges to things they know they can win -
 and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to
avoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent).
The point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright
is not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think
of as property. One key difference is that if you don't defend it,
you lose it. If you left your car sitting in the driveway, with
the window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove
away in it, that would still be theft - and you'd still be
entitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are
aware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you
are voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for
the same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a
copyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products
whenever they're mentioned, and not use words like ""Coke"" or
""Kleenex"" as generic terms. They don't really expect everybody to
do what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of
one's product become the generic term for a product is actually a
great marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some
point could start using the word on their own product, arguing
that it is in the public domain.
The efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually
stopping the exchange of music between individuals - which they
know from long experience, increases their sales because most of
the people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with
near-perfect copies. For most of them, the learning curve and the
cost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the
cost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is
committed by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the
first place. What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at
establishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright,
in the broadest, most public way; to prevent anyone from making a
legal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain.
The thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is
the change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music
commerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a
few good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for
if they were buying the stuff song by song. The problem is how to
make as much money on a per-song basis - and, at the moment, it
requires charging far more for an individual song that most people
are willing to pay.
At any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of
civil law, with a good deal of history behind it - dating back to
the Renaissance. The strategies music companies use are clearly
directed to realities and necessities, in light of history and
case law. They have also done a great PR job, convincing the most
technically knowledgeable people on the Internet that it is a
simple moral or criminal issue. ""Common sense"" tells a lot of
people that copying music without paying for it is just like
stealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. But if
common sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have
the law in the first place. Most of our great intellectual
systems, including not only law but science, are designed in large
part to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the
case in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those
systems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that
most people aren't - and that it can work to their advantage. Any
time a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an
issue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a
matter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what
he means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you
believe that. If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't
be paying him as much as he is.

My Virtual Model
http://www.myvirtualmodel.com/
{Make a model of you} Wouldn't it be cool if you could physically
walk into cyberspace? Well, you can't... so stop thinking about
it. However, you can design a virtual model of yourself on this
site. Choose your features like body shape, eyes, nose, lips,
facial hair, height, and weight. The amazing thing is how closely
your model resembles you. My only complaint is that you can't add
glasses. How in the heck is my digital doppelganger supposed to
see? Once you're finished, the site can even offer style advice
for your body type. (I'll stick with plaid, thank you very much.)

Who has no trouble with controling his codes? Lockergnomie Wayne
Smith: ""Here is a bit of information specifically for Hotmail
users who may have trouble opening your links, due to the service
wanting to place the referred URL in a separate frame. I receive
my Lockergnome newsletters via Hotmail and find it really useful
when you folks include the link as text. However, sometimes this
isn't practical - or it stops the flow of the article. The trouble
here is that the link sometimes returns the message: 'There was an
error displaying this link' in the frame. No problem! Right-click,
copy shortcut, paste to metapad (freeware from LIQUIDNINJA.COM),
then do a global search and replace. The trick is to replace the
control codes with the correct characters: %26 is an ampersand;
%3a is a colon; %2e is a period; %20 is a blank space; %2f is a
forward slash; %3d is an equals symbol; %3f is a question mark.
The Windows character map can help with any others. Select a
character, look at the status bar, replace 'U+[code]' with the
percent sign. In other words, the ampersand (U+0026) is %26 which
translastes into a '&' symbol. Maybe a more clever Gnomie can come
up with some script which we can place in the 'Web' folder,
correctly register, and use in IE's right-click / context menu?""

Dear Reader,
Personal lasers come in shapes, sizes, and prices to suit almost 
any user. A low-end desktop laser printer can cost as little as 
$199 or as much as $500, but most hover around $300 and strike a 
good balance between speed, quality, and features. The less expensive 
models will suit students or home users who need to print letters 
or homework assignments, as well as perform other simple tasks. 
In pricier models, vendors typically add more RAM, higher-capacity 
paper trays, duplexing capabilities, and networking options for 
corporate and small-business users.
Check out a few of our favorites below and find the laser printer
with the right price and features for you!

GET WINDOWS XP TIPS:
Months after the release of Windows XP Professional and Home editions, people are still learning the nuances of Microsoft's newest operating system. Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley.

I don't go to many concerts, but that doesn't mean I don't
appreciate listening to
good
music
at every waking moment.  night, a handful of Bay
Gnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore.
Melanie, Steve, Brent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and
Mindy had a total blast. Well, it wasn't much fun when Robert got
his digital camera confiscated - but this was a show worthy of
five
megapixels
(believe me)! Brent went to
the show last night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this
afternoon. They were selling a new CD (which had JUST been
released the other day); ""They Got Lost"" is full of a few
previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about purchasing
it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial
EMusic account
and download
a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the opening
act: Noe Venable. She's got
a few free MP3s
on
her site, too. Give ""Boots"" a shot - very nice.
Does anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me
as a gift (which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the
manual - but the ones and zeros start to look eerily similar after
flipping past the first page. You know me: I'm not much of a math
guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day that 'byte' was
short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'
represented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece,
but it just isn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that?
I'm ready to walk on the wild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop
pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've been known to do nutty
things on a moment's notice, like changing my default Web browser.
Courtesy of
Asa
Dotzler
, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD, and t-shirt
(which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too
jealous;
Mozilla.org
has
plenty of goodies to go around.
Looks as though
Jake
and Lori
are already having a blast in St. Louis.
They're at the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds
of well-known program programmers - the people who make our
computers work the way we want them to work! We're doing our best
to convince them to join us at
Gnomedex
. They ask: ""Who else
is going to be there?"" We answer: ""People who don't know you yet.""
They ask: ""Then why should I come?"" We answer: ""Because it's a
business opportunity for you."" They ask: ""What if I don't want to
learn anything or meet anybody?"" We answer: ""We can't really help
you there, but here - have lunch on us."" They ask: ""Oh, the
admission price includes food at at Gnomedex?"" We answer: ""We
cannot provide every meal, but you won't go hungry."" They ask:
""So, why Des Moines, when there's nothing to do there."" We answer:
""You're 100% wrong. There *IS* something to do there: Gnomedex.""
Get it? Got it? Good.
See You in

GigAlarm v1.201 [33k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://users.bigpond.net.au/glina/GigAlarm.htm
{String on your finger} Sometimes, I'm a bit like the absent-minded professor... I would forget my own head if it wasn't attached. So naturally, I appreciate any program that can help keep me on track, and with GigAlarm I can setup whatever reminders/alarms I need. However, sometimes a simple text message just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of GigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a WAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program, or use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the habit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too long on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The author says, ""This program is essentially free to use for non-profit purposes... If you find this program useful I would appreciate $10 AUD (or $5 USD) as a token of your appreciation.""
Context Thumbview v1.0.b1 [107k] W9x/2K/XP FREE
http://contextmagic.netfirms.com/image-viewer/
{Peep show} I'm not always very patient, especially when it comes to my computer. Double-clicking on an image and waiting for it to come up in my image viewer is almost too much for me to handle. Lucky for me, Context Thumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view an image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose ""View Thumbnail,"" and there is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open up any programs! ""As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always ready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window, including Open and Save As... dialog boxes."" As an added bonus, with Context Thumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I want to save system resources.

Starter v5.5.4.2175 [423k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://codestuff.tripod.com/
{Startup manager} This application bills itself as ""Yet Another Startup Manager""... I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.

Aversoft Sticker v3.55 [592k] W9x/2k/XP US$15
Unearthed by Sergei Lepyokhin
http://www.aversoft.com/sticker/
{Sticky notes} Did you know that Post-it(r) Notes were invented by accident? I use to have these notes all over my monitor. Now my screen is clean as a whistle! Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember ""important information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop."" No more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook. Time to send out today's newsletter!

GnomeTIP
Gnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: ""Did you know that you can copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?"" Alex also had this to say: ""When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text (along with several other options)."" Those are some great time saving tips Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving yourself some time.

Let me first welcome all the new people to the Sporadic -- there were a bunch of people who signed up a while ago but never got added until today, I think the problems have been fixed.  There are currently over 250,000 subscribers to this 
list (dayam!).  Of those, I think there are around 5 people who actually read it.
So anyway, raise your hand if you're older than 30 and have never been married.
Unless I meet the girl of my dreams tomorrow (which is unlikely as I don't plan on leaving my apartment tomorrow, much less wearing pants anytime in the near future), looks like I'm headed in that direction.
I never think about it but it seems I'm supposed to.  I definitely don't want to be one of those guys who's a bachelor for life, and I eventually want kids, I think that's cool!  But today, October 30, 2002, is my 27th birthday.
celebrate, I bought myself some Rogain, tooth whitener, and a gym membership.  My detergent makes the skin on my back hurt and I still have zits.  Oh hey I bought a new guitar and
played dress up
, that was fun.
It's 4:00 AM and I'm eating expired ham.  Somehow I'm able to write a newsletter to 250,000 people, yet my birthday plans involve sitting home alone teaching myself Journey songs on the guitar.  then Blockbuster and Chinese delivery.  
Woohoo!
Anyway, thanks for being there.

Cable companies cracking down on Wi-Fi
Broadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
Time Warner Cable of New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within 300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send additional letters, while AT&T Broadband also is preparing similar letters for some of its customers.

Apple's iPod comes to Linux
Windows users have recently been given access to the popular Macintosh music player, iPod, and now Linux users may soon be able to take a bite out of Apple Computer's gadget. Last week, tex9, a small software-development company in San Francisco, began beta testing an iPod plug-in for its xtunes music player software, which is itself a Linux clone of Apple's iTunes. The plug-in will, tex9 promises, allow drag-and-drop access to iPod, which holds up to 10GB of music.

Microsoft hopes to extend its Passport online identification system into authorizing credit card payments.
The software giant will strike a partnership Tuesday with security-software maker Arcot Systems, which builds online payment systems for merchants and for banks that issue Visa and MasterCard credit cards. Arcot makes the systems behind Visa's own Verified by Visa program as well as a similar program in development at MasterCard.

A federal judge said Monday that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copyright lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popular Kazaa software.

The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) sued three prominent file-swapping companies in October in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software.

CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP

   Original release date: July 22, 2002
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1

Overview

   A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could
   be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP
   and/or the web server.

I. Description

   PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use. For more
   information about PHP, see

          http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php

   The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for
   handling  file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a
   specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server, an attacker can
   corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP. Specifically, an
   intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be
   freed.  In  most  cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or
   the  web  server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to
   take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the
   privileges of the web server.

   You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some
   implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the
   execution  of  arbitrary  code.  However, because PHP utilizes its own
   memory  management  system,  the  implementation of malloc and free is
   irrelevant to this problem.

   Stefan  Esser  of  e-matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot
   execute   code   on   x86   systems.   However,  we  encourage  system
   administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x86  systems  as well to guard
   against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques
   that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.

   This  vulnerability  was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described
   in  detail  in  their  advisory.  The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an
   advisory.  A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status
   regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.

   Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP  4.2.0  and  4.2.1,
   e-matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older
   versions  of  PHP.  If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP, we
   encourage you to review
   http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html

II. Impact

   A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
   An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due
   to  the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage
   this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and/or the web server running on an
   x86 architecture.

III. Solution

Apply a patch from your vendor

   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this
   section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular
   vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.
   Please contact your vendor directly.

Upgrade to the latest version of PHP

   If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor, upgrade to version
   4.2.2.

Deny POST requests

   Until  patches  or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST
   requests.  The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security
   Advisory:

     If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on
     HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST
     requests on the web server.

     In  the  Apache  web server, for example, this is possible with the
     following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a
     top-level .htaccess file:

     <Limit POST>
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
     </Limit>

     Note  that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have
     parameters contradicting the example given above.

Disable vulnerable service

   Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP.
   As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that
   are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully
   consider your service requirements.

Appendix A. - Vendor Information

   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
   advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their
   comments.

Apple Computer Inc.

          Mac  OS  X  and  Mac  OS X Server are shipping with PHP version
          4.1.2  which  does  not  contain the vulnerability described in
          this alert.

Caldera

          Caldera  OpenLinux  does  not provide either vulnerable version
          (4.2.0,  4.2.1)  of  PHP  in their products. Therefore, Caldera
          products are not vulnerable to this issue.

Compaq Computer Corporation

          SOURCE:  Compaq Computer Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary
          of  Hewlett-Packard  Company  and  Hewlett-Packard  Company  HP
          Services Software Security Response Team
          x-ref: SSRT2300 php post requests
          At  the  time  of  writing  this  document, Compaq is currently
          investigating   the   potential  impact  to  Compaq's  released
          Operating System software products.
          As  further  information  becomes available Compaq will provide
          notice  of  the  availability  of any necessary patches through
          standard  security bulletin announcements and be available from
          your normal HP Services supportchannel.

Cray Inc.

          Cray, Inc. does not supply PHP on any of its systems.

Debian

          Debian GNU/Linux stable aka 3.0 is not vulnerable.
          Debian GNU/Linux testing is not vulnerable.
          Debian GNU/Linux unstable is vulnerable.
          The  problem  effects PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. Woody ships
          an  older  version  of  PHP  (4.1.2),  that doesn't contain the
          vulnerable function.

FreeBSD

          FreeBSD  does not include any version of PHP by default, and so
          is  not  vulnerable; however, the FreeBSD Ports Collection does
          contain  the  PHP4  package. Updates to the PHP4 package are in
          progress  and a corrected package will be available in the near
          future.

Guardian Digital

          Guardian  Digital  has not shipped PHP 4.2.x in any versions of
          EnGarde, therefore we are not believed to be vulnerable at this
          time.

Hewlett-Packard Company

          SOURCE:  Hewlett-Packard Company Security Response Team
          At  the  time  of  writing  this  document,  Hewlett Packard is
          currently  investigating  the potential impact to HP's released
          Operating System software products.
          As further information becomes available HP will provide notice
          of  the  availability of any necessary patches through standard
          security  bulletin  announcements  and  be  available from your
          normal HP Services support channel.

IBM

          IBM  is  not vulnerable to the above vulnerabilities in PHP. We
          do  supply the PHP packages for AIX through the AIX  olbox for
          Linux  Applications.  However,  these packages are at 4.0.6 and
          also incorporate the security patch from 2/27/2002.

Mandrakesoft

          Mandrake Linux does not ship with PHP version 4.2.x and as such
          is  not  vulnerable.  The  Mandrake Linux cooker does currently
          contain  PHP  4.2.1  and  will  be  updated shortly, but cooker
          should  not be used in a production environment and no advisory
          will be issued.

Microsoft Corporation

          Microsoft  products  are not affected by the issues detailed in
          this advisory.

Network Appliance

          No Netapp products are vulnerable to this.

Red Hat Inc.

          None  of  our commercial releases ship with vulnerable versions
          of PHP (4.2.0, 4.2.1).

SuSE Inc.

          SuSE Linux is not vulnerable to this problem, as we do not ship
          PHP 4.2.x.

Brooklyn Bridge for sale! No kidding! The town of Brooklyn, 
Iowa has a bridge that they are
selling on Ebay
, so if you have a need for such 
a structure, or just want to have the right to say you 
legitimately purchased the Brooklyn Bridge, here's your 
opportunity! Seriously, this is not a prank!
Ever since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had 
a cup-o-java with Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving 
coffee. I can't see myself turning into a coffee junkie like 
Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being 
that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited 
to the severe need for a quick morning wake-up or in an 
effort to keep warm on cold mornings when out in the field 
back in my Marine Corps days.
As time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the 
typical geek vices of sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink 
coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and what's the point of 
drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An 
artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo, 
Iowa. Most of what Diana and I use sugar for has been 
modified to use Splenda instead, with good results. 
Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it 
usually is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from 
the nasty breath. It's fun to test out the dragon-breath on 
the cat to see just how bad it really is. If Bootes sniffs a 
couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly 
recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of 
minutes. See what you've started, Jake?
See You in

Exchange Titanium Details Emerge
http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asp
Oracle recently announced their intention to compete 
directly with Microsoft Exchange, even accepting Outlook as 
an email client. In what seems like a direct response, we're 
handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange Titanium. 
I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly 
looking forward to seeing what the new features will be all 
about, but I'm also interested in what Oracle will be 
bringing to the table. Better email functionality, control 
and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up being 
the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A is a screenshot 
of what Outlook may look like once Office 11 is released. 
It's an interesting concept shot, showing some new ways they 
plan to handle email views. It doesn't say anything for 
Exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless.

Better Pocket PC Audio
Unearthed by David Spencer
http://home.adelphia.net/~mdukette/downloads.html
An open source project is bringing a different spin to 
audio and video on Pocket PCs, and my first impression is... 
cool! I like what they're working on here. I decided to wipe 
out my Jornada yesterday, so I haven't done a direct 
comparison between the iPaq 3870 and Jornada 565 for audio 
quality using this player, which has an equalizer built-in, 
but it definitely has potential judging from how it sounds 
on the iPaq right out of the gate. Definitely give this a 
peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and 
video on a Pocket PC. Quite a few different versions are 
supported, so you should be able to find something 
appropriate to your device.

Where's Java?
http://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.html
Three readers asked me about this very thing this week, 
and it's something you should probably know about if you use 
Windows XP. Microsoft didn't bundle the Java Virtual Machine 
with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has been avaialble via the 
Windows Update site as a ""convenience"" to users. Part of Sun's legal
complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that Microsoft did not have the right to 
distribute their implementation via the web, though 
they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows. 
So essentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems. 
Well, to avoid further web distribution arguments, Microsoft 
has yanked the JVM from the Windows Update site and all 
other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is still 
planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1. 
You'll have to plan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is 
still a ways off and you can't get it from Microsoft at this 
point. If you need it for a new installation of Windows XP 
in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with
their 
own distibution
.

Another Xeon Deal
Served up by Warren Dugas
http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/Search ols/item-details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P
I mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual-
Xeon workstations a few weeks back, which I know several of 
you took advantage of, but the $1999 price tag likely scared 
off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon, check 
this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000 
workstation with a single 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160 
drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses for both Windows 2000 Pro and 
NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there is NO memory 
and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for 
yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole. 
Also realize that these systems take RAMBUS memory, which 
will add a bit of cost, so be sure you know what you're 
getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure! Expandability is also quite amazing with these machines.
Recommend It!

WORD: coruscate  \KOR-uh-skayt\  (intransitive verb)

:    give off or reflect bright beams or flashes of light; 
   to sparkle.
:    exhibit brilliant, sparkling technique or style. 


SYNONYMS:  *reflect 
           *shine

EXAMPLE SENTENCE:  
Exotic stones and pebbles coruscate on the ocean floor, giv-

Also from coruscare is the adjective coruscant, ""glittering 
in flashes; flashing.""

turn some heads. No need to feed:

   MARINE AQUARIUM
   Version: 0.99.0
   File size: 3MB
   License: Free to try; $12.95 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X

   As the name suggests, this program puts an incredibly
   realistic aquarium of saltwater fish on your screen. You can
   select from a variety of highly textured fish to swim across
   your desktop, and you can control variables such as lighting
   and the number of fish. There is even a starfish that you can

   IN MULTIMEDIA AND DESIGN:

   QUICKTIME
   Version 6.0
   File size: 402K
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS 8.6/9.x or Mac OS X

   The latest version of Apple's premiere media application
   supports the increasingly popular MPEG-4 codec for high-
   quality, highly compressed video, as well as modern formats
   such as AAC (Advanced Audio Codec) and JPEG 2000. It also
   provides skip protection, an enhanced user interface with a

   and other useful features such as support for Flash 5 files.

   CARTOON EDITOR
   Version: 1.2.1
   File size: 2.38MB
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X

   Cartoon Editor won't turn you into a gifted cartoonist
   overnight. But what this graphic editor will do is make quick
   work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--
   and for OS X freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.
   Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which
   you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you
   group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful
   cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for
   some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,
   antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.

   License: Free
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X

   Get in touch with the natural rhythms of our solar system
   with MoonDock, a simple piece of software that tracks the
   phases of the moon for you and displays lovely images of our
   planet's companion satellite on your desktop. The images are
   high-quality color photos that change over time in accordance
   with the date. MoonDock includes both astronomical and survey
   data, meaning that you can calculate the appropriate moon
   phase for a particular date and identify topographical
   features on the moon using a built-in catalog of those that
   have been surveyed by astronomers and astronauts. This update
   incorporates improved help features and a few bug fixes.

   with relative ease; and work with a full selection of tools

Canning spam without eating up real mail
Like a growing number of Web surfers, Audrie Krause faces a new uncertainty when she hits the send button on her e-mail these days: Will the message get through?
As the head of a political action group, Krause uses members-only e-mail lists to help educate and organize fellow activists. So she was jarred recently when one message bounced back with a note accusing her of spreading unsolicited junk e-mail, or spam.

Tech companies chase homeland security
Software companies looking for greener pastures are turning to the red, white and blue.
Whether out of heartfelt patriotism in the wake of Sept. 11 or the desire to tap into the nearly $38 billion budgeted for homeland security spending in 2003, many information technology companies that previously paid little attention to government contracts are now going to great lengths to attract government business.

Lukewarm response to Juniper moves
Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass.
Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive.

The announcement includes various deals with different telecommunications companies and airports, made under the banner of Cisco Mobile Office, a campaign for wireless LANs (local area networks). The airport deals are at different stages, from a fully fledged paid-for service run by wireless provider Mobynet at Turkey's Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, where the wireless LAN was included when the airport was designed in 1999, to others that are still free trials.

Rhapsody rules
I never thought I’d say it, but I’m changing my tune about subscription music services.
When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.com’s
Rhapsody
, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now I’m rethinking my stance.
Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, you’ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you can’t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s? Let me know at

Here are some representative responses from last week's question on who should take the blame for Web sites not being compatible in every browser:
""Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience""
A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.
""There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.""
After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.
""The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser.""
Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.
""As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.""
Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.
""Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified.""
A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.

Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths 

A reporter came by the Lindows.com
offices
last Friday. He told me that he wanted to try and use
LindowsOS to
write a story, but he didn't think it was possible because his office
used Microsoft Word .doc files. I asked him to have a seat and watch.  

I turned on the Walmart.com
computer
and then clicked on the running man
which took me to the Click-N-Run Warehouse
where I installed OpenOffice
using Click-N-Run. I then clicked
the ""Run It""  button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer.
I then typed ""Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save
hundreds using LindowsOS."" I selected ""Save as Microsoft Word.""

The reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters,
he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple
word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For
Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to
overcome a couple of myths. 

The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That
may have been true in the past, but we've annihilated this myth with the
latest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5
minutes. It's point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating
system (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at
.  

The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the
graphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist.
Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps
over the last couple of years, but they've gotten quite good at reading
and writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these
products is via the Click-N-Run
Warehouse.

 Here's a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in
the Warehouse
all downloaded and
installed with a single click:

OpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an
impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open
the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and
swap them with Microsoft counterparts.
Programs included are:

OpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs) 
OpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel) 
OpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint)
OpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program

Click here
for a great
tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice.

GIMP
If you are familiar with Adobe's Photoshop,
you'll want to Click-N-Run GIMP. It's a powerful image editor. 
 

Evolution
For those used to Microsoft's
Outlook email program Evolution will make them feel right at home. Check
out how easy it is to use
.

Flowchart Pro, which is similar to Microsoft's Visio, is a  rich
charting program that makes it possible to create flow charts and
organizational charts, plus more. See how easy it for yourself, visit
Flowchart Pro at
This is just a handful of the quality programs available in the
Warehouse
that make Linux a practical choice
for the desktop today. And if you're still not convinced, then do the
math.
For  a total cost of $499
, including
all  software, computer users save  more than $800  for a complete
system. 

With such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped
systems, any business, school or home will find their computing dollars
stretched much further running LindowsOS.

Reader Jack Macdonald has some advice for you would-be bards in the audience:
""You mention Karaoke being featured at Gnomedex and you 
might want to point out to other Gnomies that they could 
practice their Karaoke on my
Red Hot 
Karaoke Page
site. There are the words and music for 
more than 1100 songs available on the site and by 
downloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is provided) they 
can even change the key of the song to suit their voice 
range as well as speed up or slow down the music to their 
taste. In other words, to have the same experience as they 
would have with professional Karaoke equipment but at no 
extra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to 
Gnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly 
prepared for your Karaoke.""
Travel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to 
help out a former co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server 
and networking stuff. The tough part is remembering 
everything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always, 
always, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks 
in advance and I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a 
handprint on my forehead when I come to the realization that 
I left something important behind. What will it be this 
time, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday.
See You in
August

Forwarding to Internet Address Fails
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636
Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all 
internal and Internet email to his AOL mailbox when he's out 
of the office, and I figure it's going to be a piece of 
cake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along 
with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was 
the driving force behind this request. What I found was that 
Internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding 
rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent 
out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to 
be included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a 
default configuration option on the Exchange 5.5 server that 
prevents automatic replies/forwards from being sent to the 
Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A quick 
configuration change and restart of IMS will put things 
right.

Stop the Presses
http://www.wininformant.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=25802
... The CD presses, that is. Microsoft has given in to 
the greater good and delayed Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 
indefinitely. Sure, it's mildly disappointing, but I applaud 
the move. Instead of trying to downplay the previously 
identified problems with Microsoft Installer (MSI) 2.0, the 
service pack will be put on ice until the issues are 
straightened out. Here's a quote for you... Good job, 
Microsoft.

Windows XP System File Checker
Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a 
possible solution to my Windows Media Player problem under 
Windows XP, and I did indeed run through it prior to 
attempting an in-place upgrade, obviously with no 
improvement. It's still worth a mention, however, in case 
you're not familiar with what it's there for. As you're 
probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that 
will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or 
altered in any way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable 
state. Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack, 
and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any 
hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left 
in place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is 
used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has 
been messed with.   access the SFC, simply launch a command 
prompt and type ""SFC"" to display a list of options.

Consider This
Forwarded by JW
http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html
The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected 
representatives, you might want to start asking about their 
opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and 
right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain 
death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz 
Hollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman 
gets his way, companies may very well be allowed to hack 
into your systems without proof of provocation in order to 
ensure that you are using their software according to the 
stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or 
upset other systems, there isn't thing one you can do in 
return. Nope, they'll have legal protection. This garbage is 
seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be abused, 
consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly 
pointed out eBook security problems with Adobe's software 
and was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the 
authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He was 
eventually released, but that doesn't make it any more 
right.

http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_ urrilhes/Linux/Linux.Wireless.usage.html

"" 11 Access Points, Home Gateways and Ethernet bridging
Most Access Points act as a MAC level bridge, allowing the Wireless LAN to 
be a natural extension of a wired network. They are deployed in a cellular 
fashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming.
On the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to 
a WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is 
quite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration.

The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't 
work with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation 
and the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most 
often, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux 
bridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous 
is broken as well). ""

[[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge 
our networks? ]]

"" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC 
headers (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the 
right place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on 
how to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in 
hardware, to force you to buy their Access Points).

In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or 
wireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about 
turning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. ""

[[ Is this true? ]]


"" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other 
methods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... ""


[[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan <-> wired-lan bridge. 
But I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?


Vince. ]]

BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A JET?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in
the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's
sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.

The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the
bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be
traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened
except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White
House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the
first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the 
major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2
billion in the past year.)

Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in
pain.   all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce
competition from discounters, a too-small area of service
concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with
United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business.
Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years
ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by
United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators
that it was too small to survive on 
its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.

Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those
likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has
vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their
jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of
millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially
plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a
bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter
who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one
creditor was named in any account we could find. Yet before we
soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word
from the folks getting stiffed.)

Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which
observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability""
thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that
anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is
plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas 
Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and
pocketed 11 times its investment.

Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways
customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York
Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor
frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use
U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner,
United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, 
there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next
major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel

REMEMBER GLOBAL CROSSING?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Follow-up has never been the media's strong suit. Once stories
fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this
summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global
Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to 
recall the fuss over chads.

The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday
a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be 
holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because 
the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention,
especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the
Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to
say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed 
for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million -- and
that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back
in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three
times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian
conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies
Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. 

Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the
deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the 
regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two 
investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and
bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the
slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The
company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the
crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,""
the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for 
the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times
quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend 
its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. 
But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is
simply buying low so it can sell higher. 

Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is
approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary
Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock,
as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom
bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah

Brother, Can You Spare a Jet?
Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.
The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2 billion in the past year.)
Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in pain.   all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce competition from discounters, a too-small area of service concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business. Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was
too small to survive on
its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.
Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one creditor was
named in any account we could find. Yet before we soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word from the folks getting stiffed.)
Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability"" thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and pocketed 11 times its investment.
Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner, United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel

Remember Global Crossing?
Follow-up has never been the media's strong suit. Once stories fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to recall the fuss over chads.
The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention, especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million --
and that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more.
Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,""
the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is simply buying low so it can sell higher.
Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock, as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah Asbrand

  Japanese Crime Noir in DivX Video
  ---------------------------------

  A wide variety of innovative studios and film distributors have
  been using DivX video-on-demand technology to sell downloadable
  DivX titles online since August of last year. One of the many
  interesting films currently available is the Japanese crime
  thriller ""Nobody"" from DivX partner Vanguard Cinema. Called ""a
  triumph"" by the New York Times, ""Nobody"" is an action-packed
  thriller-noir that tells a story of an escalating cycle of
  violence and revenge. In the tradition of international crime
  thrillers like ""La Femme Nikita"" and "" kyo Fist,"" ""Nobody"" takes
  the viewer through a labyrinth of suspense and carnage without
  release until the very end.

Angstrom Microsystems, a small Boston company specializing in 
   thin servers, has released a new model that squeezes two servers, 
   each with two Advanced Micro Devices Athlon 2100+ processors, into

   be bolted into regular 19-inch racks, typically costs between 
   $4,000 and $5,000, depending on configuration options, spokeswoman 
   Rachel Sun said.

Greetings from Download.com!
No software developer is immune to bugs. Even the cleanest code
will have to go through a debugging process, but some debuggers
are more efficient than others. Check out Download.com's
complete collection of debugging tools

, and put away the
can of Raid.
Also this week, we've got some very handy utilities. First,
there's Chilkat, a cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can
add to any language with ActiveX support (which is most major
ones). But my personal favorite is VB-PowerWrap, a simple tool
that takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual Basic
masterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file
for ease of distribution.

Chilkat Zip 6.0.2
Need to add zip capability to your apps? Create and
   decompress zip archives with the Chilkat Zip ActiveX
   control. The control provides easy access to individual files
   stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within
   the zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual
   files or files matching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to
   any directory, and the control's memory management allows any
   size file to be compressed or decompressed in a constant
   memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly
   from memory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files
   with wildcarding. There's even a real-time progress monitor
   for zip and unzip operations. Chilkat supports Active Server
   Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++ Builder, and all
   languages that use ActiveX controls.
in Java
Anfy Java 2.0
Anfy is a collection of 52 applets for Web pages, desktop
   wallpapers, or screensavers. Within the program's simple
   interface, you can quickly apply real-time graphic effects to
   GIF and JPEG images. Effects include 3D texture-mapped cube
   menus, lake effects, water and fire, deformations, zoom
   rotators, lens magnification, waving flags, animations,
   scrolling text, customizable IFS fractals, color changers,
   light shading, tunnels, and wormholes.

VB-PowerWrap 3.1
Distribute Visual Basic applications the easy way with
   VB-PowerWrap. VB-PowerWrap embeds all dependent and
   non-dependent files into the executable of your VB program,
   including DLLs and OCXs, graphics, databases, and text files,
   to create a single clickable application. VB-PowerWrap scans
   a VB project, wraps the appropriate files, and creates a
   self-contained file for distribution. In addition,
   VB-PowerWrap compresses all DLLs and OCXs and registers
   appropriate controls on the user's machine if needed. It
   works with Visual Basic 4, 5, and 6.

Slowing sales shrinking Intel workforce
Intel announced lower-than-expected earnings yesterday and that

(5 percent of its staff) would be eliminated this year. This may bring Intel's margins back in line, but the overall
outlook is not bright
in the coming months, despite Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's optimism about a more timely recovery.

Software contracts: Clause for alarm
In the high-stakes game of corporate software negotiations, the silver-tongued sales rep isn't your biggest challenge: It's 
the
language in the contracts
. Enterprise customers spend surprisingly little time pouring over the fine print of 
multi-million dollar software contracts that are rife with obscure terminology, vague expansion charges, and
mind-boggling 
license conversions
. As a result, they end up paying in ways they had never imagined long after the deal is signed. Just 
ask California.

No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.

One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
same box).

For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
we've been there.)

ZDNet AnchorDesk Newsletter
TUESDAY, JULY 16, 2002
Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,
As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday
Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.
Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.
Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.
For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works.
I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on
CNET Radio
every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.
Sincerely,
David Coursey
Executive Editor

Scripting flaw threatens Web servers
A flaw found in newer versions of the PHP Web server scripting language could allow attackers to crash, and in some cases control, computers over the Internet, an open-source developer group announced Monday.
The vulnerability affects versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 of PHP, according to the PHP Group. The flaw compromises different computer architectures in different ways: Web servers running on Intel IA-32 hardware could crash, while other systems, including Sun Microsystems' Solaris, could allow the attacker to infiltrate the computer.

Butterfly will also use CollabBet's SourceCast Web application to enable game development teams to share source code, manage art assets and design games for the Butterfly service.

Russian firm points out new Adobe flaw
Thumbing its nose at the company that landed one of its employees in jail, ElcomSoft is pointing out new flaws in Adobe Systems' eBook software.
The flaws could allow someone to check out every copy of every book in Adobe's new electronic library for an unlimited amount of time by changing the values in the loan form. However, the bugs were discovered on an Adobe test Web site that demonstrates how the software could be used to set up a lending library--not an actual site that offers books--and ElcomSoft gives information about how to fix the flaws.

British scientists on Monday announced the completion of one of the building blocks for large-scale data sharing over the Grid--a proposed network of computers seen as the 21st century successor to the Internet.
The project was carried out by scientists from the U.K.'s E-Science Centres and was co-funded by IBM and Oracle. The companies, rival powers in the database market, contributed both funding and the efforts of their own researchers.

Dear readers,
If the majority of your photos are posed snapshots and
landscapes, a fast camera may not matter. But if you've ever
missed a shot because your camera was busy processing the
previous photo, the Leica Digilux 1 will appeal to you. We liked
it too, and we gave it an Editors' Choice award.
Leica Digilux 1: Legendary charm
The legendary German lens maker takes aim at digital-era
  street photographers with the Digilux 1. A combination of
  speed, manual control, and advanced features helps this
  4-megapixel camera provide a digital option to shutterbugs
  with an eye for the decisive moment.

This new flash-based MP3 player blew us away right out of the
  box, with its slick styling, 128MB of expandable memory,
  in-line remote control, and low price. The fact that it can
  encode WMA files in real time from any line-level
  audio source is the icing on an already very tasty cake.

Jobs touts OS X, iPods, iMac
NEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
Jobs used his keynote speech at the Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of free i ols.

The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.

Scient files for Chapter 11
Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to sell certain assets to a professional services firm.
The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.

Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.




The company and SBI said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that financing ""will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received.""

Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouth
What does Yahoo Mail have against mocha?
That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word ""mocha"" and discover that while in transit, ""mocha"" mysteriously changes to ""espresso.""

  protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.




The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

Unisys splits Intel server line
Unisys, a specialist in high-end servers, is coming out with a new lower-cost line of Intel-based servers as it gears up to promote the Itanium 2 chip.
Unisys' new Aries servers accommodate as many as 16 Itanium 2 or Xeon processors and cost between $75,000 and $300,000, said Mark Fevertson, Unisys' vice president of server marketing. It joins the Orion line, which can use up to 32 Xeon or Itanium 2 processors and has been on sale for about two years at a cost between $140,000 and $700,000.

Microsoft sweetens Mac Office offer
With sales of its Office suite for Mac OS X falling short of projections, Microsoft plans on Wednesday to announce a rebate for those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac.
The promotion, which runs through Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or server.

New chip may portend ATI comeback
ATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms of performance.
The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources.

The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.

Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians say

WASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been 
charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding 
government-issued credit cards?

(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.

(b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.

(c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf 
membership.

(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river 
rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert.

(e) all of the above.

""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, 
Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal 
government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, 
the military has launched a raid on your wallet.""

The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office 
audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly 
unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 
2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax 
credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees 
carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 
billion in goods and services, the audit found.

In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and 
government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, 
then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to 
supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their 
travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.

""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a 
strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling 
suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, 
take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, 
reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the 
worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even 
imagine.""

Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury 
cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and 
armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.
 
Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit 
noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can 
be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" 
such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. 

Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of 
documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, 
so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.
  
""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat 
Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse 
taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said.
 
""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard 
against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to 
force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, 
instead of offending the taxpayer.""

It's official: Gretchen, Sprocket, and I will be moving in a few
weeks. Not too far, though. We'll be going deeper into the city of
San Francisco starting on the first of September. Lori and Norm
were here over the weekend (for a photo shoot); in between sets,
Gretchen invited them to join her hunt. They came upon a house
located in one of the busier parts of town. With only street
parking available, I wasn't too thrilled about investigating the
property. However, my wife seemed optimistic. We kinda knew what
we were looking for in a residence (and its neighborhood), but
also knew we'd have to make certain concessions in the process. We
parked (literally) up the hill and found our way to what would
turn out to be our future home (at least, for the next year or
so). It has lots of usable space - which is a premium here. Plus,
the landlords are extremely dog-friendly. Winner! The pictures and
videos will come, never fear.

First order of business: get broadband! According to AT&T's Web
site, cable modem service is not available in the area. However,
DSL is an option. So, it looks like I'm going to be purchasing an
external

modem

Yeah, I'm not even sure who I'll select for my provider. They
currently use SBC to get online, so I might just stick with them
for continuity's sake. Verizon has been solid enough for me here,
but I believe our loft complex has a unique infrastructure. If I
could make contact with someone from any capable system, I'd
probably go with them. I should probably get the ball rolling
soon, though - I'd hate to play the waiting game for too long.
I've heard of installation nightmares, so I'll probably be rolling
my own (again). 56k is quaint, but hardly enough pipe to get any
real work done. When you download as much as I do, every bit
counts. Oh, and did I tell you about the bites?
There are plenty of unique restaurants in just about every
direction. Plus, we're right up around the corner from a Peet's
outlet! If you need me, you know where you can find me. I'll
probably also be setting up a Wi-Fi network before too long, too.
My Proxim hardware still works, but I wasn't sure if I needed a
crossover cable to connect it to my router. Furo tells me: ""If the
hub has an uplink port, then a straight cable should work between
the two, as it provides the crossover for you. If both have uplink
and non-uplink ports (workstation attachment ports), then you
would need a crossover cable between like ports. For instance, if
you were connecting a workstation port on one to a workstation
port on another, you'd have to use a crossover. Same for uplink to
uplink."" How's that for home network helpfulness? Oh, if only he'd

{Screen print utility} Time is money, and I endorse any program
that can save me time. Luckily, that is exactly what Print! v1.6
does. Say that I want to share screenshots with my other tech
friends to compare error messages and talk about possible fixes:
every time I take a screen shot, I open up Word, paste the
snapshot, and THEN I can print it.  o many steps, too much of my
time! With Print!, I just hit my ""Print Screen"" key and out comes
my screenshot without involving any other programs. Don't want a
screenshot of your whole desktop? Not a problem, just press Alt +
Print Screen and you'll have a printout of the active window only.
Print! 1.6 goes so far as to put the date and time on your
printout too... perfect for saving those high scores on solitaire!

invert images. (So, not only will you save time, you'll also save
on toner. Bonus!)  You may also want to note that Print! saves
your printer configuration without wreaking havoc on the settings
in your other programs. You'll definitely get your money's worth

back to BookCrossing (think of wheresgeorge.com). Then you just
leave the book ""in the wild"" to be found by someone else; the

GnomeTIP
Any modem that relies on Windows to function is dubbed a
""Winmodem."" Most manufacturers use ""Winmodems"" because they are
cheap and easy to set up on a standard model PC. I don't have any
problem with the manufacturer saving money (because living in a
capitalistic society, I would hope that the savings would trickle
down to ME in one way or another). I do, however, have a problem
with the way ""Winmodems"" function after you add more internal
devices to your PC. ""Winmodems"" rely on Windows to mediate their
serial communication (I/O address, COM port, IRQ, etc.) and as you
can imagine, the more devices Windows has to manage, the higher
the probability of running into a problem. And what if you want to
run Linux instead? Will the ""Winmodem"" function well, if at all,
in an operating system other than Windows? Don't bet on it! If you
want to make sure you don't have any problems after upgrading your
system, you'll want to get yourself a hardware modem. How can you
determine this? Checking a modem's system requirements. If the
modem says it REQUIRES Windows, then keep looking... you've found
yourself a ""Winmodem."" However, if the system requirements for the
modem say that it will work with Linux, then you've found yourself
a hardware modem. Yes, it IS that easy.

* Come work on Thinking in Java in Crested Butte
* Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent
* Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 6 Available
* Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar, Bay Area, November
* Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar, Bay Area, November
* New seminars
* Limited Number of Signed Copies of TIJ2 for sale

See the Calendar for the current schedule:
http://www.mindview.net/Calendar

===================================
* Come work on Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, in Crested Butte

All but one of the Interns has departed (he's staying through
December) and we have empty rooms in the condo that I rented in Mt.
Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to
volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late
Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay
in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java,
please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and
availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of
October). There will be a technical and writing test, and
interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with
others.

This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.

===================================
* Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent

The second revision will be up on the site soon, at:
http://64.78.49.204/

The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the
multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The
goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of
threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this
simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).

The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their
final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done
yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.

Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the
beginning of the book.

The book is due at the end of October. The print version will
appear in December.

===================================
* Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrow

Available at:
http://64.78.49.204/

Chapters 1-4 are finished

===================================
* Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar
November 4th-8th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/ThinkingInJava/

Created by Bruce Eckel, taught by Andrea Provaglio. We believe this
is the best in-depth introduction to Java that you'll find.  It's
based on the book ""Thinking in Java,"" which was created as the
seminar evolved.

Please note the early registration discount: 
* $1,600 for payments received by October 12th
* $1,950 for payments received after October 12th

===================================
* Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar
November 18th-22th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/J2EE/

Created and taught by Andrea Provaglio, this seminar introduces you
to the practical development of real-world, Web-enabled,
distributed applications with Java. It covers J2EE and its key
technologies: Enterprise JavaBeans, Servlets, Java ServerPages, and
the basic architectural patterns used to combine these technologies
into maintainable applications. 

Andrea has been teaching this course in the US and in Europe for
the last two years, and he has recently restructured and updated
the seminar to include the latest J2EE features.

You'll come out of this course with a comprehensive understanding
of the J2EE architecture, of the problems that it is designed to
solve, how to select the most appropriate tools, and how to code
your solutions.

Please note the early registration discount: 
* $1,700 for payments received by October 26th
* $2,300 for payments received after October 26th

===================================
* New seminars

Bill Venners and I just finished giving the last ""Objects &
Patterns"" seminar, and everyone (especially us) had a great time.

We are now beginning to work towards the two new seminars spawned
by Objects & Patterns, which Bill and I plan to teach together:
Design Patterns in Java
(Drawing primarily from ""Thinking in Patterns"")

Designing Objects & Systems
This will include a lot of material from Bill's upcoming book on
Object Design, along with coverage of UML, XP, Object-Oriented
Design techniques and guidelines, and of course exercises and
projects.

We hope to begin teaching the courses early next year. Stay tuned.

===================================

GNU/DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT GNU/LINUX

>  Frederick Noronha

INDIA: There's good news round the corner -- international organisations and
prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of
Free/Open Source Software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the
immense promise it holds out to the Third World.

But can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? 

>  the Unesco to the World Bank, and other global organisations, all are
catching up on the potential of using GNU/Linux as a potent tool in working
towards development. More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial
office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's
earnings.

United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal
<radhika.lal@undp.org>, a Information-Communication Technology Policy
Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for
E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.

infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington
University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to
draw participants from local, national and international organizations from
both the public and private sector.

This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness
about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More
importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors,
users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source,
e-Government and related fields.

Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for
Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.

ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet
for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy.
But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world,
so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.

See http://www.egovos.org/

OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N.
======================

Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be
showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source
tools. 

Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. 

It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.

UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin <jc.dauphin@unesco.org> of the Information
Society Division also announced that this international organisation has
been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software
movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science
and culture.

It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called
the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising,
updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for
including new basic documents. 

""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can
be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,""
said Dauphin.

UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)

NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS
======================

Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange
from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and
IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and
to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. 

CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is
freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within
the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code
(GPL license). 

See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtml

Meanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme)
based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously
about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and
related issues.

""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid
Akhtar told this correspondent.

Niranjan Rajani <niranjan.rajani@maailma.net>, of Pakistani origin but based
in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on
""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"".

This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has
undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for
Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.

This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use
of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects;
GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World
countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies
and lives of these countries.

CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS
======================

In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick
presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. 

Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's
the message that governments across India were recently with, as official
computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and
speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.

Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in
attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing
giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long
lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.

Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US
Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are
making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in
varsities, military installations and within government. 

Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information
Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre
of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems
supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the
government sector.

On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for
Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the
news.

GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed
out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)

""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare
Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access
to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater
<dirk@welfarelaw.org>. 

While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one
another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle
remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. 

Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet
in low-income communities, access is still an issue. 

Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not
sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have
access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their
homes. 

LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great
for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent
face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.

""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that
works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to
discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95<
according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income
Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.

LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems
that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving
a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed
like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar
projects but had limited success,"" says Slater. 

LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using
donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led
organizations that LINC serves. 

""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use
open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to
document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide
details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC
explains.

LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and
installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in
people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone
computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.

Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local
support.

""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely
successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether
the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more
effectively,"" said Slater.

===============

Bala Pillai <bala@tamil.net>, who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in
Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an
organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the
impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.

Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time
zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino
psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. 

""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more
time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it.
Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to
more symbiosis with them,"" says he. 

Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted
with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.
""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key
Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. 

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is
another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look
for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. 

""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is
likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or
publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and
found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this
work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds.

 : Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative]
 : 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMT

Dear friends,

Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source
Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to
support their cash-strapped initiatives? 

Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study
of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.

Jeebesh Bagchi <jeebesh@sarai.net> sent in this offer recently. It could
surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to
make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. 

It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely 
workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger
initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If
such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for
greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like
ours. --FN

Michael's Minute: 
Lindows.com Report Card 

As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their
report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of
grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..
view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click
here
. 

Operating System:  

As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways.
One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com
, for as little as $299. This is a
significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder
(Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the
box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks. 

For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we
offer the Insider program
. This gives
people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS
as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about
80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow,
consequently, this product is not yet for everyone. 

Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart
when the program available directly
from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is
the Walmart
computers are certified,
ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much
different than offering a software program that will work on any
computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference
between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus
opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The
first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job.

While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS
installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support
a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B
  _____  

Software: 

Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on
their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to
add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school,
home or business.

Click-N-Run
is the easiest way to
load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system
has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With
1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse
, users can find quality software
titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click
download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included
in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point.
Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future.
Grade: A-
  _____  

Microsoft Windows Compatibility:

We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the
legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to
support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help
people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers
come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft
applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel
documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people
to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize).   edit
Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our
Warehouse such as OpenOffice
. 

Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since
they're included in the Warehouse
.
Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're
investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based
programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer
support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to
MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get
better in the above areas.  Grade: B 
  _____  

Communication:

We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going
which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute
. While our overall goal has not deviated -
Bringing Choice   Your Computer - our implementation has become more
focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have
told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing
running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you
detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs,
forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating
system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid. 

Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change
the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library
of 1,000+ software titles all for a
flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to
think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable.

There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around
- which happens when you have a small organization which can't address
every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these
in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the  p Myths about
Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade:

LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being
offered from Lindows.com
Builder
partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download
and preview to Lindows.com
Insider
partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to
install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The
General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware
and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an
existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation
process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a
select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs. For more information

When I was in Omaha a couple of weeks ago, I made the 
unfortunate mistake of driving through the intersection of 
90th and Dodge. Those of you in Omaha know what sorts of 
things I was muttering under my breath during the ordeal. Is 
it possible to suffer from road rage when you're not moving? 
Omaha has started a
10 
year project
on Dodge street, which more or less divides 
the city in half east to west. The traffic tie-ups due to 
the construction disaster at 90th and Dodge are being felt 
by nearby businesses. A
bank 
is fighting back
in a creative way, replacing random $20 
and $10 bills in their ATM machine with $50 and $20 notes 
respectively to reward lucky customers for their patronage. 
And I just drove right by the place.
The route to Des Moines from Waterloo isn't much better 
right now as they widen highway 330/65 to 4 lane between 
Marshalltown and Des Moines. Once that's done, it will cut 
20-30 minutes from the trip, and judging from the progress 
they've been making, it won't be too much longer. That's 
probably the fastest moving highway construction I've seen 
during my travels throughout Iowa over the years. As you 
travel to
Gnomedex
from all manner of locales, be sure to keep tabs on 
construction at
this handy 
site
put up by the Iowa Department of Transportation.
See You in

Iomega Intros 750MB Zip
http://www.iomega.com/zip
I've all but ditched Zip drive use entirely due to cost 
and small capacity. I know many people that still use Zip 
drives, and I still play with a 1GB Jaz drive from time to 
time, but with the ease and low cost of CD-RW drives and 
media, Zip just hasn't stood a chance. Now that Iomega has 
bumped the capacity to 750MB, employed USB 2.0 and pushed 
the speed of the drives significantly higher, maybe it's 
still worth a look for those that need a fast removable 
media option. I'll stick with CD-RW myself. I'll sacrifice 
some speed for the reliability of optical media. But that's 
just me.

Technical Overview of .NET File Services
http://www.microsoft.com/windows.netserver/techinfo/overview/file.mspx
.NET Server is more than Windows 2000 with a look of 
Windows XP, of that you can be sure. Common sense has 
finally won, with the developers delivering many more 
command line tools to manage core services. Of course, this 
isn't the only thing being brought to the .NET table. 
Improvements in DFS, defrag, chkdsk and EFS just scratch the 
surface. New WHQL processes are being established for 
antivirus products, allowing them to hook directly into the 
OS. Virtual Disk Service, Volume Shadow Copy Service and 
promised improvements in the File Replication Service should 
make managing storage easier and more flexible.

P4 Performance Goes to Court
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asp
A class action lawsuit has been filed in California by a 
small group of PC owners that are miffed about the 
performance, or lack thereof, that was promised by Intel, HP 
and Gateway. Since the day the P4 was introduced, the 
overall performance has been criticized, so this would seem 
to be more an issue of failing to do proper due diligence on 
the part of the customer, if you ask me. This is one of 
those subjective questions that will come down to fancy 
lawyers and luck of the jury pool draw. If they believed 
everything the TV commercials had to say, then the litigants 
got what they had coming. One beer tastes better than the 
next, only one car can save your life in a crash, etc. This 
general lag in P4 muscle has been publicized since day one, 
as have crash test results on the part of the government and 
third-party organizations. Should we be suing auto makers 
when someone dies in a 5-star rated vehicle? That Volvo will 
save your life, ya know. Does this set an unreasonable 
expectation? Only if you consider advertising an education.

THE ISO17799 NEWSLETTER - EDITION 4
______________________________________________________

Welcome to the fourth edition of the ISO17799 newsletter, designed to
keep you abreast of news and developments with respect to ISO17799 and
information security. 

The information contained in this newsletter is absolutely free to our
subscribers and provides guidance on various practical issues, plus
commentary on recent Information Security incidents. 

Guidance and information included in this issue:

1)  The ISO17799  olkit Uncovered 
2)  Social Engineering - Are you Susceptible?
3)  ISO17799: A World Wide Phenomena
4)  Stranger Danger
5)  ISO17700: More Frequently Asked Questions
6)  Credit Card Transactions - Minimize the Risks
7)  BSI Certifications - Congratulations
8)  ISO17799 Section 11 - BCP Review
9)  It Couldn't Happen Here.... Could It?
10)  Subscription Information



THE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED
==============================

The ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of
an introductory pack appropriately called 'The ISO17799  olkit'. But
why was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack?  

The purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying
start with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard
itself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more
quickly.

The contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the
organization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in
embracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first
critical steps to compliance.

In the former group are the 'RoadMap to Certification' (which broadly
describes the process of gaining certification), the 'XL Management
Presentation' (which explains the history, background and current status
of the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both
parts).

In the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include
a comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address
section 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to
help address section 11 (Business Continuity Management).

It doesn't end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed
set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For
newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary
of terms.  

Clearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,
in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of
ISO17799, it can be invaluable. 

More information on the ISO17799  olkit and how to purchase can be
found at: http://www.iso17799-made-easy.com

The standard itself can alternatively be procured from:  
http://www.iso17799.net 



SOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?
=========================================

The term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually
based around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to
IT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary.

Following interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches
has been produced. These are designed to gather information without the
target even realizing that they have parted with it.

The attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations
for this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone
is probably the major source of pre-meditated acts.  

The following are some of the major techniques employed:

BAITING
This essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some
leading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. Often, items of
conversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is
legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places.

PULLING RANK
This amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the
company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does
not necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be
assumed. 

EXHAUSTING
This involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down
the target.

SURF BOARDING
Basically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something
confidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a
doorway, etc.

SURVEYS
The information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to
a criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate
purposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case
sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed.


There are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be
prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. 

Before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish:

a) the sensitivity of the information
b) your authority to exchange or release the information
c) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)
d) the purpose of the exchange

The act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes.



ISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA =================================

Disney would have said ""it's a small world after all"", but the global
take on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are
embracing it with enthusiasm.

  illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a
table from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799
Electronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a
serious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card
purchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as
others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase
position significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires
substantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last
500 from the download location.

That aside, the table makes interesting reading:

STRANGER DANGER
===============

As you read this article, look around at your working environment. The
items/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because
you deal with them every day... but now look again.

If you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?
What would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor
passing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can
you see?

The chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not
want to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,
the security of your information is at risk potentially from every
visitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. 

This article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,
but nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if
due caution is not exercised.

The following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are
minimized:

* Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure
that visitors wear them

* Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.

* Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges

* If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours

* Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they
are doing

* Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...
don't let them make their way to you

* Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID

* Do not leave visitors alone   



ISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
==========================================

1) How many controls are there in the standard?
Part 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and
over 500 detailed controls in total.

2) What is part 2?
Part 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to
build and operate an information security management system.

3) How old is it?
The standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in
the UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000.

4) What is accreditation?
An accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties
under the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in
different countries.

5) Is certification for life?
No. It is normally for three year periods.

6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally
created? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from
representatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,
Norway, UK and USA, amongst others.

7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?
No. It is generic in terms of legislation.



CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS
============================================

The use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has
become an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are
associated information security risks which we should pause to consider,
especially when making payments over the Internet.  

Web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods
and services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber
criminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods,
which can then be easily exchanged for cash.  There are also relatively
simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers
to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time,
from millions of people. A survey by the IT research company Gartner
(http://www.gartner.com) predicted that Internet crime involving the
""mass victimization"" of consumers could take place by the end of this
year.  

We recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the
risks involved in credit card transactions:

* Ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the
Internet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they
have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific Internet
purchases.

* All expenses incurred through Internet transactions should be
carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies.

* Only enter credit card details on a Web site if you are confident as
to its authenticity and that the connection is secure - the prefix https
(as opposed to the usual http) in the Web Site address indicates a
secure connection.

* If the security of a Web site is in doubt, any confidential
information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent.  Be
extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where
the Internet Service Provider hosting the site is not verified. Note
that we have pre-checked all sites referenced in this newsletter for
security!

* If ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are
talking to the correct person.  If you are unsure whether the
organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively,
pay by some other means.

* Lost or stolen credit card details may be used for Internet
transactions.  Inform the card issuer and relevant person within your
organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen.

ISO17799 SECTION 11: BCP REVIEW 
===============================

Business continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a
core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business
continuity plan.

Creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course.
This is one reason why software products were produced. Unfortunately
these often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn,
expensive, etc.

Recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with
organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex
task. At the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in
MS-Word: The BCP Generator.

This was designed from top down to simplify business continuity
planning. It comprises two components: a plan template and an
interactive guide (the latter using Word macros to jump to and fro into
the correct part of the template). It's impact upon the business
continuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very
largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. It is in
active use in over 40 countries.
  
With this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market,
there is now NO excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. The old
lines of ""too expensive"" and ""too difficult"" are now less hollow than
they ever were. Although section 11 is very clear with respect to the
need of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due
diligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one.

For information on the BCP Generator see: 
http://www.disaster-recovery-plan.com

IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE....COULD IT?
====================================

Every issue of The ISO17799 Newsletter features at least one TRUE story
of an information security breach and its consequences. Again, in this
issue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents:


1) On 25th October a contract programmer who had once worked for a large
US based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the
security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). In the
dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and
interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run - noting down
security codes as they were entered. He then left and hung around
outside until just after normal trading time.

He then rang the Bank from a public phone box and initiated an
electronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a Swiss account. 

The plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes
incorrectly, but he rang the Bank department back and incredibly managed
to trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit.

He flew to Switzerland and later returned with the money. He was caught
simply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. When
the police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their
loss!


2) Remote, or dial-in access can be a real Achilles heel if not properly
controlled. In a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major
company's system by using the default password of a system engineer
(which had never been changed!). 

This gave him considerable scope and powers of access.   cover for
himself, however, he semi-disabled the machine log, changed a number of
user passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered
with the dial back system.

Getting more ambitious he established a communication link with another
computer and ended up making it crash. All this took place over a couple
of evenings.

  recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime
computer and restore from the previous weeks back-up, at considerable
cost.


3) Over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions
within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to
critical levels. The impact was such that the business fell behind with
its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third
parties. As it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it
started to lose the confidence of its customers. The situation began to
spiral. 

Eventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called
the police. Secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor
staff. One was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units
and also attaching paper clips to them. Both these actions led to a
short circuit.

When confronted, he confessed everything. His motive was to earn
overtime, which was required to process the overlap work which was
delayed by the malfunction. He netted 689 UKP over the 9 months. The
company lost at least 500,000 UKP.

Greetings from Download.com!
If you're developing Windows applications in an
ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones
such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking
advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com
every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that
handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls,
and edit hex code to get you up and running.
Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries:
FileSystem 1.2
and
AppSecureX 2.9
. FileSystem gives you access
to drives, folders, and I/O operations; and AppSecureX adds
serial number and shareware-type functionality to your
applications.
Becky Waring
Contributing Editor, CNET Download.com
Builder.com
Six
MySQL/PHP functions to streamline development
Code reuse is one of the keys to increasing developer
     productivity. This article looks at several handy functions
     you can use to save time when building applications using
     PHP and MySQL.
Faking
SOAP principles with familiar techniques
SOAP is everywhere you turn. But what exactly is it? Take
     this guided tour to gain working knowledge of this emerging
     standard.
in ActiveX
FileSystem 1.2
Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The
   FileSystem ActiveX control offers complete access to common
   file information under Windows through three independent
   interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access to file
   I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code.
   Use this control's interfaces to detect media types and
   media insertion, get complete lists of folders and files at
   unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes are set on
   files, and even load logbook files into collections
   automatically. Rope in your files.
ApSecureX 2.9
Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX.
   This control provides a registration system that produces a
   valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When
   the user installs your software, a unique ID number is
   generated for that system.   get the serial number, the
   user must provide you with his installation number. The
   data file created by the application is encrypted
   differently for each system, so even if someone were to
   crack the file, they couldn't use the information on
   another machine. AppSecure can also give your software
   shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking
   to see if the system clock is set back, and so on. AppSecureX
   works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
   Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo
   application is included. Lock up your software.
in Java
AppletFile 2.5
AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your
   Web site's file upload and download capabilities. In
   addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated
   uploading, users can upload and download multiple files
   using predefined paths to automate the process as much as
   possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated
   customization, and the user interface includes support for
   12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
   applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC
   feature downloads only updated files, and verification of
   file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in
   support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on
   HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds
   Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and
   shows removable media drives in the browse dialog. Beam up
   your files.
in  ols & Editors
PHP Master Editor 2.0
Write, edit, and debug PHP scripts and HTML pages with this
   tool. PHP Master Editor includes an internal browser for
   viewing, as well as a debugger for local testing. Basic FTP

CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW
The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email
Saturday, July 20, 2002
Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Compute=
r trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it migh=
t be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by
unveiling
new=
 iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u=
se Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi=
sting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with=
 a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo=
r $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m=
odels for Windows users with MusicMatch software.
As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon=
itor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut=
ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.
Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will =
be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with =
improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t=
he background photo as often as every 5 seconds.
But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a ch=
eap upgrade when the company announced it will
not offer
a disc=
ounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr=
ent users of the operating system.   get Jaguar, current OS X users will h=
ave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst=
em for the retail price of $129.
Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu=
alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s=
hare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser=
vices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou=
s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.
Apple also raised eyebrows by
transitioning
its i ols Web serv=
ices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t=
o charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service=
s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a=
 service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu=
res.
Despite i ol's popularity, the company
may face a tough sell
w=
ith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture=
. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously =
free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when=
 free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to=
 form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently=
.
its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of=
 services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz=
ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,=
 an
online petition
protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel=
l for the program.
Microsoft's moves
Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to
offer a=
 rebate
for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software=
 bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re=
bate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for=
 those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.
The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no=
t met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000=
 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the =
program went on sale last November.
Microsoft is also putting the
finishing touches
on the third co=
llection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after=
 a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c=
ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o=
perating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co=
uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f=
ixes are available as separate downloads.
Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro=
soft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has
shut down
a =
site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T=
he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java =
inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the=
 forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.
Somebody's watching you
You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yah=
oo is.   protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter=
 to
swap out
a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that=
 pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contai=
n JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaS=
cript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser=
 to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for =
example.
""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced =
e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will =
open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma=
nds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command =
line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'=
s knowledge.
On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. g=
overnment is again turning to technology to
monitor suspicious acti=
vity
in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled mor=
e details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan=
 to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or =
suspicious behavior.
""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the dail=
y course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual=
 or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. =
But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan,=
 fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib=
ly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.
Also of note

!
Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I 
start with the basics, for that reason,  I'm going to take things 
step-by-step,  following my own learning process and progressing to 
gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in 
programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript 
to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script 
Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in 
scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be 
targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get 
up to speed.
I'm off to the
Shareware Industry Conference
for the remainder of the week, 
where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very 
bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows 
community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get 
there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing 
out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place 
while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at 
other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is 
being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services 
I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I 
can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this 
evening just to be sure.
With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via 
my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis. 
Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't 
use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A 
landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some 
updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking 
lots of photos, as usual.
See You in

Same-X v2.0 [1.73MB] OSX 10.1.1 FREE
http://www.thumpbunny.com/
Seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes 
this a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to 
clear the board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two 
or greater at a time. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring 
awards clearing of larger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no 
swearing, but you'll find yourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway -- 
not to mention you can feel safe sharing this with kids.

Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE
http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/
It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application 
unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, 
for small office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this 
is the only real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost 
painless, making it easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your 
Mac with little difficulty. The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is 
quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection 
management, and share configuration into a convenient Prefernce pane.
GnomeSCRIPT
Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing 
application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the Script 
Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is located in the 
AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the application for 
the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, Description 
and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons.
Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The 
Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what 
it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke 
your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable application, the 
information in the description will show up in the start up screen.
The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling 
applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for scripting 
is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level drilling 
down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate 
with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the 
bottom up. Telling the ""Applications"" folder to tell its ""Jake"" subfolder to tell 
the application ""Jake's Media Player,"" located in that folder to do something 
could also be written by telling the script to access ""Jake's Media Player"" 
located in the ""Jake"" subfolder of the ""Applications folder,  The upcoming example 
will make this a bit more clear.

Flash animations,  downloadable icons, artistic doodles, and details about 
the artist himself are available from this site. You're guaranteed to find 
something entertaining here, and if you need a logo designed, Von Robert 
Glitschka might even take you on as a client. The portfolio is extensive, 
including stock images and even some icons by the artist's seven year old 
daughter. A must read is the anatomy of an illustration section, which lays 
down artistic opinion, straight from Glitschka's mouth on how to make a 
funny creation. This is by no means a Mac only site, the entertainment is 
accessible by everyone and icons are available in both Mac and PC versions.
GnomeTIP
Traditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the 
desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder 
only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered 
with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything 
when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay organized. 
For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on the desktop, 
OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their place. Open the 
Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes under Show these 
items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons to clutter the 
desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing at all.

Tech stocks drop again on Qwest criminal probe news
Word telecom Qwest Communications International is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office in Denver helped send technology shares lower Wednesday.
Despite a Merrill Lynch upgrade of Cisco Systems and the fact that J.P. Morgan began coverage on AOL Time Warner with a ""buy"" rating, CNET's Tech index fell 26.23 points, or 2.66 percent, to 965.29. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 35.11 points, or 2.54 percent, to 1,346.01--a multi-year low.
Broader markets also shed value, dragged down in part by a troubled pharmaceutical sector. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 282.5 points, or 3.11 percent, to 8,813.5, and the S&P 500 slid 32.36 points, or 3.52 percent, to 920.47--also a multi-year low.
AT&T, Comcast Shareholders OK Broadband Deal
Shareholders of AT&T Corp. and Comcast Corp. on Wednesday approved the planned $27 billion merger of AT&T Broadband with Comcast, which will create the nation's largest cable TV operator with more than 22 million customers.
Telephone giant AT&T in December agreed to sell its cable television unit to Comcast as part of a restructuring that dismantled its vision of becoming a one-stop shop for telephone, data and video services.
AT&T CORP 9.78 -2.30%
$215 million later, start-up Pluris shuts down
Networking start-up Pluris will release a statement Wednesday announcing it has closed its doors because of a lack of funding and ongoing woes in the market it serves, according to a spokeswoman familiar with the company's plans.
Pluris, a once promising company, burned through $215 million over the past few years as it attempted to build a high-end router that was intended to outclass similar products from competitors such as Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems.
CISCO SYSTEMS 13.51 2.82%
WorldCom contracts under U.S. scrutiny
The accounting scandal at WorldCom has prompted U.S. government agencies to scrutinize the telecommunications company's billions of dollars in federal contracts.
The Federal Aviation Administration, for one, has been forced to take stock of the situation quickly. WorldCom is a finalist for a 20-year, $3.5 billion contract with the FAA. The contract is expected to be awarded as soon as this week. The company is the incumbent on the contract, which supplies phone and data infrastructure to the nation's air traffic control systems.

Banc of America Securities lowers estimates and price target on IBM in notes 7/10/02
Analyst Joel Wagonfeld argues the computer giant is not immune to the persistent, widespread weakness in IT spending. But a roughly 6 percent dip in revenues during the second quarter will be offset by the elimination of losses from the discontinued hard disk drive business, Wagonfeld predicts. In IBM's second-quarter results, he expects continued weakness in hardware but relative strength in software and outsourcing. The company's decision to exit or restructure unprofitable, commodity businesses is sound, Wagonfeld says. He reiterates a ""buy"" rating on IBM.

Last week,
Axialis Software
released IconWorkshop v5.0 - arguably the most powerful icon
editor / manager for the Windows platform. Ever the icon addict, I
asked for your pixel-perfect creations. I have yet to receive one.
Perhaps you've been waiting for the right motivation? How about a
nice little contest involving some of the most powerful sites on
the Internet? Here's the deal: you create five (or more) icons
between now and the end of July 2002, upload them to your [FREE]
DeviantArt account (under Contests / Axialis Icon Contest), and
one of the five judges may pick it. The panel includes: myself,
MattEO from
DeviantArt
,
KarmaGirl from
WinCustomize
, Voodoo from
Neowin
, and Marc from
Axialis. We'll each pick our favorite set. The winners will not
only receive one copy of IconWorkshop Corporate Edition, but some
of their icons will get bundled with a future version of the
software! Ownership is retained by the original author, so don't
hold back. Here's your chance at fame and fortune. Or, at least
fame and free software.
Ah, the life of a software junkie! Pieter just released the new
(unofficial)
Google Search ol
today. It's much more convenient than the official toolbar (sorry,
I just don't like browser add-ons). I also gave
Cacheman
another go; I haven't used it since Windows 98. It's always been a
great piece of shareware, but I didn't realize it was THIS good.
The speed increase has been quite noticeable (even on Storm Shadow,
my P4 2.5GHz machine). Outer Technologies is brilliant. And so is
Repligator 9.0
. It gives
me access to instant special effects - a one-stop shop for digital
photo fun. I'm still debating whether or not to install the latest
Java runtimes. It seems to be unobtrusive on my test machine,
which is good to see; I don't want browser integration, I just
wanna run that awesome ASCII Art program. Oh, and ""12 Mistakes
Executives Make When Planning Web Strategy"" is available for FREE
with the purchase of ANY
Gnome me
(including our 50
freshly-released OS X tips). Go grab it if your boss doesn't know
as much as s/he should.
There's a little bit of Oingo Boingo on
Emusic
now. They inked a
deal with Universal Music Group today - and I'm not paying any
more to get access to even
more MP3s
. This is the ONLY
way to go, and I hope and pray that more record labels will
eventually catch on to the craze. The Internet is more than a
place for a pseudo-interactive pamphlet; the Internet fosters
knowledge; the Internet is still in its infancy; the Internet has
encouraged creativity and commerce. The one thing the Internet is
NOT: a fad. Its potential is limitless, as long as it remains
flexible and not controlled by any one company. This
Palladium
thing has got me more than a little spooked. It, combined with the
service-oriented OS, could very well be the thing that drives
people away from the Windows platform in droves (as much as I hate
to admit it). Software and music pirates unwittingly created DRM.
I best not find out that you're part of the problem.
See You in
August

Groone's Recipe Holder v1.1.0 [8.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.groonesworld.com/rholder.htm
{Recipe lister} The best thing about this recipe holder? The
conversion calculator. I've always wondered how many teaspoons
were in a gallon. There are a few delicious recipes already
included, to help you start your collection of favorites.
Everything is nicely divided into categories, too. Need a salad?
Then click ""Soups & Salads."" (Easy!) You can also make shopping
lists. The printing capability is nice too, since I'm assuming
most of you don't keep your computer next to the stove. ""If you
have an up-to-date computer with Win2000, XP, or 98SE with the
latest version of IE, then you can download the version with no
runtime support since your computer has all the necessary files.""
SolarInfo v1.0 [1.1M] FREE
http://www.sulaco.co.za/downloads.htm
{Sun, moon, and planets} Why is it all the other planets have
really cool names for their respective moon(s), but Earth's is
simply referred to as ""moon?"" We should change it to something
catchier, like ""Joey Joe-Joe Junior Shabbadu."" Don't mind me, I
was just looking at this new application. It shows a graphical
representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to
every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides
detailed information such as the planet's distance from the sun,
its volume, mass, and gravity in relation to Earth. What I found
most interesting was how long a single ""day"" lasts on different
planets. Did you know one day on Pluto is equal to six days on
Earth? I guess he chased Chip and Dale around the Christmas tree
for longer than we thought.

TightVNC v1.2.4 [660k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.tightvnc.com/
""VNC (an abbreviation for Virtual Network Computing) is a great
client / server software package allowing remote network access to
graphical desktops. With VNC, you may allow yourself to access
your machine from everywhere provided that your machine is
connected to the Internet. VNC is free (released under the GNU
General Public License) and it's available on most platforms. The
original VNC distribution can be obtained at the AT&T research
labs site. Here you can find enhanced version of VNC, called
TightVNC (grown from the VNC Tight Encoder project), which is
optimized to work over slow network connections such as low-speed
modem links. While original VNC may be very slow when your
connection is not fast enough, with TightVNC you can work remotely
almost in real time in most environments. Besides bandwidth
optimizations, TightVNC also includes many other improvements,
optimizations and bug fixes over VNC.""

Pop-Up Menu Navigation Software
Scribbled by Pat Wong
http://popup.jscentral.com/
I found some really cool software to generate Web site navigation
menus, and I thought you might be interested in learning about it.
There are several examples on the company's site, as well as on my
own. Here's a small write-up about it; perhaps you'd be interested
in running this in a future Lockergnome issue? We've all seen a
lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up text, neat
mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a
combination of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise
that goes way beyond some of us. At last, it's possible to easily
generate just such a menu with some very user-friendly screens to
enter the data you want to use.
Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully
licensed version ($34.95 for a Home User license / $129.95 for the
Web Designer license). The biggest difference? With the licensed
version, you get the ability to save a menu you've generated so
you can modify it later. Your only alternative, if you want to
make even a simple change to a menu generated by the freeware
version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or diving
into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be
forewarned: The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that
could potentially be a nightmare. I decided to buy the fully
licensed version and I'm really glad I did. Sorry if I sound like
a commercial for the company; I don't work for them or stand to be
compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this
menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while.

Calculator
Unearthed by a Gnomie
http://www.calculator.com/
{Calculate it} Calculators aren't just for adding and subtracting
numbers or spelling silly phrases by turning the calculator upside
down. How about figuring out the financing on your new car? What
about the seeding rates for your wheat farm? Perhaps you
programmers out there need a nice HEX calculator. And, of course,
what football fan wouldn't like to calculate the passing rates for
his or her favorite quarterback? If it seems like I'm all over the
map here, it's because this site provides links to all kinds of
calculator sites for all kinds of people. Trust me: it all adds up
to a unique and useful site.

Who knows how to thwart false charges? Lockergnomie Steve
Lafferty: ""In a recent article over the PayPal issue, it was
stated that when using a credit card illegally, the owner of that
card is responsible for the first $50.  However, sometging that
very few people know about is that there is a US Federal provision
in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E / Electronic
Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in
favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your
'bank card' is used without your permission, you are not
responsible for any of the charges. My suggestion is never to use
a credit card - and only use your bank debit card. That way, if
someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of the
charges."" For more information, please refer to Section 205 on
FEDERALRESERVE.GOV. Obviously, this tip only applies to people
living in the USA. If you haven't been watching your statements
like a hawk lately, you'd be wise to start soon. Identity theft is
a growing concern. When my wallet was stolen, I found
IDENTITYTHEFT.ORG to be a godsend.

File-traders in the crosshairs
When the recording industry last month let slip plans to sue individuals who trade copyrighted songs on file-swapping services, Web surfers everywhere pulled down their MP3 collections in a frenzy of fear.
OK, not really. Despite the music industry's hopes, such threats have so far been met with a collective yawn in the file-swapping community, which has yet to see much damage in spite of repeated legal wrangling with the Recording Industry Association of America.

Will IBM's new ""Shark"" sink or swim?
IBM announced a new top-end ""Shark"" storage system Monday that could boost the company's prospects against entrenched competitors in the depressed storage market.
Three years ago, IBM introduced its first Enterprise Storage System product, code-named Shark, in an attempt to rebuild a market it had almost totally ceded to rivals EMC and Hitachi Data Systems.

Hack attacks on Linux on the rise
Hackers are increasingly targeting Web servers based on the Linux operating system, while the number of successful attacks on Windows systems decreases, according to a new report from a U.K. systems integrator.
The study by Mi2g also found that successful attacks on U.K. and U.S. government sites have decreased, which may be due to tougher laws and improved security.

The strategic attack comes as tensions mount between Apple and Microsoft. During Macworld five years ago, the two companies announced a five-year technology agreement, whereby Microsoft committed to continued development of Office and Internet Explorer for the Mac.

Dear Readers,
I'm sure you've seen those annoying X-10 cameras ads popping up left and right while surfing the Internet. One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this bothersome company's Web site.   my amazement, I found that their miniature cameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But what does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my privacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this interesting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing these
miniature cameras
, called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them. So if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about this, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting caught on camera in an embarrassing situation.

 	  An island getaway
An island in Tracadie harbour is about to become the Nova Scotia getaway
for movie stars Ethan Hawke
and Uma Thurman
and their two children. Owner Marie Kelly confirmed she is finalizing
the sale of her 3.6-hectare island, which comes complete with two
cottages and road access across a 60-metre land bridge. She didn't
divulge the price. The couple, whom she met through a mutual friend in
the area, had discussed buying the island four years ago. But she didn't
make the decision to sell until January when her family was no longer
interested in keeping their summer home, purchased in the late 1960s.
Hawke, an Oscar nominee for his role in Training Day in 2001, visited
the Tracadie area in June. He is now on tour to promote his second book,
Ash Wednesday. His first novel, Hottest State, was published in 1996.
Thurman is known for her 1994 lead roles in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues
and Pulp Fiction, for which she received an Oscar nomination.=20

British boys reserved?
Gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow
,
currently single and searching for love, has complained that British men
just don't play the dating game the way she's used to. The 29-year-old
actress, who has a home in London and was there to perform on stage in
Proof, says: ""British people don't seem to ask each other out on dates.
If someone asks you out they're really going out on a limb, whereas in
America, it happens all the time. It's no big deal and no weight should
be attached to it. It's only dinner, for God's sake."" Gwyneth,
previously attached to Hollywood heartthrobs Brad Pitt
and Ben Affleck
,
admits she was asked out a couple of times when last in London, and she
accepted with pleasure. One of her ""very charming"" dates was actor James
Purefoy
,
who starred in A Knight's Tale, she told a magazine. But who flew in to
really save the day? A hardy Canadian lad, that's who. Word about town
is that singer Bryan Adams recently squired Ms. Paltrow around town.

A one-on-one interview
Muscle-bound Vin Diesel
,
star of the current hit movie XXX, isn't shy around reporters. In fact,
he was so taken by Entertainment  night reporter, Maria Manounos, that
he asked her out! Menounos, 24, is a former Massachusetts Teen USA
winner. She got the chance to interview the 35-year-old Diesel in July
and when the subject of dating came up, she asked if he was ""available"".
It turns out he was and a week later the pair ran into each other again
at the premiere of XXX in Westwood, California. When he saw Maria,
according to a tabloid news report, he grabbed her hand and started
whispering in her ear. He was overhead promising to see her later in the
day.

1. Feedback, notes and comments
-------------------------------------------------------------------
MACHINIMA  My reputation for small errors continues to grow (I am
keeping quiet about the big ones) with a misprint in last week's
piece on this word. In the sentence giving the etymology, of all
places, I misspelled it ""mechanima"", thus confusing everybody.

APPETITE OVER TIN CUP  Several replies came in about this saying,
confirming that variations on it and other ways of saying ""head
over heels"" are widely known, especially ""ass over appetite"" from
the US, where ""appetite"" may be a transferred term for the mouth.
But the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about,
""appetite over tin cup"", seems not to be known much at all. It
would seem to be a conflation of the British expression ""arse over
teakettle"" and the American ""ass over appetite"" (note my deliberate
use of the two spellings of ""arse"" here!). The saying was probably
modified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an
item less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these
days it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression,
which itself is now not very common.

BUMBERSHOOT  Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is
in the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film ""Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang"":

  Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
  You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
  You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
  But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo

It may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word
in their own country, have come to believe it must be British.

OLOGIES AND ISMS  The publication date of my book has been moved
back a week in the UK to 29 August. A review by Jonathon Green is
scheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the
date again). See <http://www.worldwidewords.org/ologies.htm> for
more details and UK ordering information.


2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As though we didn't have enough to worry about weather-wise, what
with global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El Ni�o season,
UN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world's
climate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping
the whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants,
carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from
burning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15%
of sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain,
leads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme
weather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed
rapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just
Asia. The term ""Asian Brown Cloud"" seems to have been around for a
couple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this
week in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists
at the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit
on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good
news, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and
climate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more
efficient ways of burning fuels.

The ""Asian Brown Cloud,"" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over
South Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million
people in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and
drought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates.
                                   [""Los Angeles Times"", Aug. 2002]

A UN-backed study released on Friday said the ""Asian Brown Cloud"" -
a vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging
agriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the
population.
                                [""Agence France Presse"", Aug. 2002]


3. Weird Words: Pyknic  /'pIknIk/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Short and fat.

Nothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way
as ""picnic"".

In the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist
Ernst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical
shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses.
Tall and thin ones he called ""asthenic"" (or ""leptosomic"") and
considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft.
A second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom
he concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The
third sort were the ""pyknic"" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of
the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were
concerned. He took ""pyknic"" from Greek ""puknos"", thick or close-
packed; it appeared first in his book ""K�rperbau und Charakter""
(Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into
English.

The American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified
Kretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body
types - ""endomorph"", ""mesomorph"" and ""ectomorph"" - that are now
more common. He considered Kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture
of the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the
Santa Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and
athletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came
up with the phrase ""pyknic practical joke"" to describe a person who
is muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and
balloons out into obesity.


4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the ""New York
Times"" that made mention of a ""mash note"". I had never heard this
term before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note.
Is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can
you give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane
Rosenthal, California]

A. You're right about the meaning of the phrase.

We have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was
the word ""mash"" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the
1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as
""a deep but fleeting affection of the heart""). A ""mash"" could also
be a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or - as
a verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex,
to flirt or seduce. A ""masher"" was a man who thought himself
irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often
unwelcome.

The evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the ""Random House
Historical Dictionary of American Slang"" and by others suggests
that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre.
Charles Godfrey Leland (best known for his ""Hans Breitmann�s
Ballads"" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem,
""The Masher"", dated about 1895, confirming this:

  The word to ""mash,"" in the sense of causing love or
  attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into
  ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress
  was often fined for ""mashing"" or smiling at men in the
  audience.

""Mash"" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about
1880. ""Masher"" in particular became a term in London society,
especially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going
classes, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing
away its collective skirts) as ""a fop of affected manners and
exaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and
fashionable promenades and who posed as a 'lady-killer'"", noting
that the word had been common ""in 1882 and for a few years after"".
In a letter from London in the old ""Overland Monthly and Out West
Magazine"" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an
impoverished theatrical company: ""This dashing youth was distinctly
conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside
us, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that
superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a
far higher class"".

A ""mash note"" (in its first appearances, ""mash letter"") was an
obvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in
1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well.

Where ""mash"" and its relatives come from has been a subject of
debate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English
word meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious
reference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and
yielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were
still around then, despite the OED's comment) remarked that some
people derived it from ""Ma Ch�re"", ""the mode of address used by the
gilded youth to the barmaids of the period"". But he thought it
really came from ""the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a
great vogue in the music-halls: 'I'm the slashing, dashing, mashing
Montmorency of the day.'"" We're pretty sure now that he was wrong,
but he could hardly know that.

Back to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he
also researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as
well as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the
introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely
accepted:

  It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors,
  C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word
  ""masher"" or ""mash"" means in that tongue to allure, delude,
  or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by
  its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be
  no doubt as to the gypsy origin of ""mash"" as used on the
  stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well-
  known impresario Palmer of New York, and I made a note of
  it years before the term had become at all popular.

Though defunct in British English, ""mash"" and ""masher"" have never
quite gone away in America. ""Mash"" had a resurgence of popularity
as student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting,
though that may be a back-formation from ""mash note"".

""A Spanish lady asked an acquaintance during a visit to Ireland
whether there was a word in his language similar to 'mana�a'. The
Irishman thought for a moment, then said: 'Sure there is, but it
doesn't have the same sense of urgency.'"" [Traditional Irish joke.]

                               time for a snooze

         There comes a time in every August when news services should
         just shut the hell up, because the weather's too hot or too
         underwater, and the world grows so dull and hazy that even
         the overexcitable hardcore at LinuxWorld wander around like
         it's Undead Expo 2002, and the Weiss-baked Macintoxins can
         barely lift their wallets for MacOS X.2, and Sun can't be
         bothered to do anything but run s/RedHat/Sun Linux/g on a
         free distribution disk, and everyone else is on holiday, or
         getting ready to be on holiday, or being told that perhaps
         they should take a holiday RIGHT NOW, and all we can do is
         look at this awful, awful EUCD legislation and stare out the
         window until dawn.

         Yeah, it's our annual no news edition. We moved to a faster
         server. Do take the rest of the weekend off in celebration.

         Or, alternatively, build up a head of overexcitement for
         the public appearance of THOMAS DOLBY - the ""Hyperactive""
         chart artist and Beatnik audio plug-in advocate who, even as
         you read this, appears to be hosting a 350 Euro-per-head
         seminar on COMPOSING POLYPHONIC RING TONES at Helsinki's
         Radisson Royal Hotel in Finland. Lucky delegates will learn
         about ""using real-time MIDI controllers for tweaked
         effects"", ""techniques for making little speakers sound huge""
         and - perhaps most distressingly - ""picking the right
         instrument and register for best audibility"". The
         cacophonous cavalcade comes to London's Soho House on Tue
         and Wed next week if you'd like to check it out for
         yourself - or perhaps hold a street protest on behalf of
         music lovers worldwide.

           - So they're better than monophonic ringtones. What isn't?

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Dijkstra finally gone? Great. Now we can hang out with those
         sloppy little unrigorous languages he never let into the
         house. Right on cue: the latest dev version of GNU
         SMALLTALK, that dirty treat-me-like-an-object ducky. Version
         2.0b sprouts HTML-embedding and experimental MySQL support -
         implying you might actually be able to do something useful
         with it. Admittedly, ""useful"" has not been a word  much used
         in the Smalltalk community recently. Many of the current
         addicts seem to live entirely in the pleasuredomes of that
         Land of Infinite Fun, Alan Kay's Smalltalk sequel SQUEAK,
         the cross-platform UI-kablooie playground which, over time,
         been overloaded with more ill-fitting metaphors than this
         sentence. But even Squeak is showing signs of returning to
         planet Earth. Talk of cleaning up the object tree are rife;
         coders are working on XP-alike skins (instead of Squeak's
         peculiarly homely interface right now). There's even word of
         a SmallTalkish scripting language in the offing. And all
         those new MacOS X Objective C hackers are following the
         trail back to the NeXT's great ancestor, giving a timely
         boost to the tribe. Xerox Parc *will* return!

         think he was looking at ""some really bloated computer
         magazines"". Of course we are, Lloyd, though we're not as
         easily swayed by gimmicks as you are, and thus can impartially
         report that NESTLE's Maryland-style COOKIE CRISP are the most
         biscuit-like breakfast ever, easily triumphing over KELLOGG's
         FROSTIES CHOCOLATE (too much chocolate, not enough ""frosty""),
         COCO POPS CRUNCHERS (clump together in this humid weather) and
         even the Winnie The Pooh-themed DISNEY HUNNY B's - and if you

         solid"" and ""might as well be small bits of gravel for all the
         chocolate flavour they impart"". While, following last week's
         announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be
         reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range

         [resembled] those 'food pills' they thought we'd all be eating
         by now""), DAVID BLANE grudgingly approved of the TWIX TRIPLE
         CHOC LIMITED EDITION (""Not bad, faintly evoking Penguins,
         which I never liked because of the thick chocolate""), and the
         whole point of that controversial ""It's not for girls""
         campaign was revealed: to position NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p)
         as a more female-friendly version of the YORKIE BAR. Other

Following further study, I've concluded:

   1. It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.

   2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.

   3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text.

Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me. 
  Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a 
sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked, 
well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with 
and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear.

Consider the two images attached below.  The first, ""no-bytecodes.png"", 
shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode 
interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, ""bytecodes.png"", taken with 
the bytecode interpreter enabled.

When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several 
rendering anomalies appear:

   - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more
     compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in ""R"" and ""o"".

   - The left side of the ""Q"" is painted in too light a shade of grey,
     causing it to drop out somewhat.  ""C"", not in this sample, has the
     same problem.

   - ""Qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient
     whitespace between them.

   - ""M"" is distinctly asymmetric.

   - The enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled
     with grey.  Contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode
     interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop.

Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off. 
It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of 
making a mess of antialiased rendering.

This may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part, 
I'm going back to Red Hat's standard packages with the bytecode 
interpreter turned *off*.

It's time again for IMHO, brought to you as always by the letters I,
M, H and O, in partnership with the goofy electronic hubris of the
Irish Internet.  IMHO will be in orbit again sometime in early
December.

   * * *   Back issues online at http://www.imho.8m.com   * * *

Formatted for easy reading in Courier New, so you might like to
print it out in that font.  IMHO also contains hyperlinks to sites
of interest or relevance: read it while online, too, and check 'em
out.

In case you're wondering, we Bowdlerise colourful language (e.g.
'bas7ard') so that IMHO can sneak past corporate obscenity filters,
like a Dublin solicitor's staff car zooming slyly down the taxi lane
with a cheap post-regulation taxi plate on top: http://xsls.com?81

====================================================================

Heartfelt thanks this ish to AnnieT, Sean, Ray and the indefatigable
Mr Brennan for leads and content.  And a big Brava! of
congratulations to Jacqueline on her outstanding occupational
odyssey, plus a Bravo! of felicitations to Badger for his famous
fourwheeled feat.

AN INTERNET EIREANNACH............................Ping An Irish Song

Yet another Irish internet company, Octagon Technologies, closed for
good this week.  And after reading the phrase for what seemed like
the umpteen-thousandth time, we were idly wondering how many Irish
tech companies blamed their misfortunes ""on the global downturn"":
http://makeashorterlink.com/?S35A63392

Oh, so it's about 450 then.  Thanks, Google.

*

The death occurred recently of that great Irish washtub musician
Lonnie Donegan.  RIP.  This seems like an apt time therefore to
reflect on his many accomplishments: his virtuoso playing of
utensil-based instruments, his worldwide commercial success, his
place in history as King of Skiffle, and how he wiped billions of
yen off the value of the  kyo stock market:
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=373A9C4F.61B@time.life
(""panic and subsequent 10+% decline of  kyo Stock Exchange when Reuters
advised 'Lonnie Donnegan' was dead"")
and also at
http://xsls.com?80
(""to Japanese ears it sounded like Ronald Reagan"").

*

UCD's Literary and Historical Society this week awarded an honorary
fellowship to the tediously brilliant American multidisciplarian Dr
Noam Chomsky.  Now the idea of some trifling college society
awarding a mere honorary fellowship actually sounds rather like an
insult to us, considering that Niall Quinn and Marian Finucane were
given *degrees* by DIT the very next day, but then Chomsky
apparently inspired some of Radiohead's most caterwaulingly blunted
songs, so we suppose it serves him right.  Anyway, if you're an
admirer of the great man's hermeutic genius, linguistic philosophy
or contentious views on US foreign policy, perhaps you might also
appreciate his amazing interview of  m Hanks:
http://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/tapes.htm#tomnnoam

Very special thanks to IMHO's London correspondent Ray Butler for
this one.

*

Key IMHO contributor Sean Lynch quite realistically predicts a post-
Budget dole queue for all of us, and wonders if we'll miss those
cash-and-job cow multinationals when they're gone?   Not if their
Irish presence was as permanent and impressive as ""the world's
leading risk and insurance services firm"", he concludes:
http://www.marsh.ie
(compare and contrast with, say, http://www.marsh.co.uk/)

*

Also: we've been remiss in the past in not featuring
EircomTribunal.com's stalwart and righteous campaigning against
Eircom's crippling rates and crippled infrastructure in this
country.  Well, we aim to redress that right now, by pointing out
(1) Their 'Banana Republic' international price comparison page at
http://www.eircomtribunal.com/dossier_banana_rep.html, which will
surely make you mad enough to
(2) Download and print out their marvellously bitter ""No More
Favours For You, Mr Eircom Employee"" flyer from
http://www.eircomtribunal.com/counterstrike_a2_nomore.html, designed
to be stuck under the windshields of the ubiquitous and bilious
blue/orange Eircom vans.
Now if only EircomTribunal.com could somehow could retrieve that
money we all lost on bloody Eircom shares...

IMHO'S PICK: JOB....................IMHO HO HO (AND A BOTTLE OF RUM)

""FATHER CHRISTMAS on a bike - Student - Giving out FREEBIES - Four
weeks"".  No, not us telegraphing our worst nightmare to our shrink,
but a job description for a position that apparently pays ""enough"".
Email tmckeagney@msn.com or hell, cycle into his perfume shop at 128
The Stephens Green Centre and show him what you can do.

And hey, if you're a crazy maniac, that's great too.  It's about
time we had an Irish SANTACON - after all, no force on earth can
stop one hundred Santas, especially if they're drunk:
http://www.santarchy.com/
(from the San Francisco Police Report, ""the naughty Santas ... had
reeked (sic) havoc in the emporium ... in an un-Christmas like
fashion."")

*

Heh.  Disproving the stereotype that all accountants are boring:
some Dublin 2 company is looking for a ""Parti-time bookkeeper"" at
http://xsls.com?83

*

Our attention-deficient gaze also fell briefly this week onto a box
ad in a Sunday paper which is seeking private investors for an
ADVENTURE SPORTS RETAILING business in Dublin.  Now this probably
just means selling snowboards or something equally tame, but in our
imagination we see IMHO readers hunting elephants, dogfighting in
biplanes over the Wicklow Hills and abseiling down moon craters.
Just in case we're right, any ""smart, experienced partner/investor""
looking for an ""equity stake/board position"" should ""express""
""interest"" to neptune@atomic.ie.

You know, it might look like we're giving these people free
advertising, but by putting their email addresses on the public web,
we're actually GUARANTEEING them spam...


                          * * * * * * * * *


IMHO'S PICK: EVENT...........................Allow Us   Demonstrate

Friday is BUY NOTHING DAY.  For the sake of your own mental health
and the socio-economic future, we urge you to give it a try.  It's
not that hard to get through 24 hours without a purchase, and those
corporate balance sheets sure look funny with a big pre-Christmas
hole in them.

The official home of BND is of course Adbusters
(http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/) and they have a run-down of
Irish activities at http://xsls.com?84... rather a disappointing line-up
at this late stage, although the Zombie-Shopping in Galway sounds
like fun - shame they're moving the day to Saturday, hopefully it's
not for purpose-defeating reasons (""Friday?  Damn, I'm working the
late shift at McDonald's... how about Saturday?"").  In addition and
elsewhere you can expect bring-and-trade markets, flypostering, free
stuff, public speaking and all the other happy faces of democratic
consumer agitation.  Punk's not dead!  Party for your right to
fight!  No Logo!  Hare Hare!  And so on.

*

We're now going to risk life and limb by mentioning an event which
is so diametrically opposed to the above that we might just bring
about the heat-death of the Internet by combining them in the one
newsletter.

We speak of course of the benighted and spiritually-denuded sickness
of the TRILOGY FASHION SHOW in the RDS on December 4th, tickets
starting at ""just E50"" (but rising to E395 + VAT, natch).  The
advertising for this bleak celebration focuses entirely on ""the most
beautiful women in the world"" who will grace the Simmonscourt
Pavilion with their airbrushed emptiness: Tyra Banks, Sophie Dahl
and Anna Kournikova (not the virus) are the only names we recognise.
You have to pore pretty closely over the small print of the press
ads to divine that it's the ""new Escada Collection"" (the who now?)
they're modelling.  And in an utterly appropriate and inevitable
partnership, tickets are available from the cultural sewage
treatment system that is Ticketmaster.

IMHO'S PICK: DOWNLOAD..................Transparent and Unaccountable

Given our internet focus and the subversive nature of our scurrilous
publishing agenda, there is only one possible download
recommendation this week.  It's the brilliant GHOSTZILLA browser, a
creation of architectural genius which brings office escapism to
heady new heights.

Designed to facilitate inconspicuous worktime browsing, Ghostzilla
sits quietly and invisibly in the background until you summon it
with a special mouse movement.  It then adapts itself to your
currently-uppermost application, for example Micro$oft Word, leaving
Word's toolbars intact while showing web pages in a subtle grayed-
out wash in the main window.  Images appear in a subdued two-tone
unless you summon them, and the overall effect is to make it look
like you're working exactly as you should be.  A casual glance from
your Office Space boss as he paces past your cubicle shouldn't
detect anything that looks like browsing.    think that someone
devoted their life to creating something so wonderfully juvenile!
It's a beautiful thing.  Go ghosting at
http://www.ghostzilla.com.


                          * * * * * * * * *


IMHO'S PICK: INTERNET^HWS................................ON YER BIKE

Roll up, roll up roll up!  Segue right this way!  Amazon is now
selling the celebrated SEGWAY (aka Ginger, aka IT) online, the hype
of the millennium finally made available to lowly consumers.  You're
only four months and five thousands bucks away from participating in
the future of transport, the most fundamental and significant
breakthrough in human evolution since the invention of the leg, the
""spirit that can change the world"", etc. etc.

Get out your chequebook and get your Segway at

The perfect expression of our post-modern mania for meta-media
(whoah! Easy, Chomsky!) is the utterly compelling 'Hoax Photo Test'
at http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/tests/hoaxphototest.html

featured it last Friday - credit where it's due)

""Imagine being able to run a Google-like search on your life,"" says
one of the prophets of doom behind MyLifeBits, an incredibly Dickian
personalised self-database being developed by - who else? -
Microsoft.  By cataloguing every single artifact of your life
history, storing everything in an online repository, you build a
searchable index of every conversation, document, movement, event
and action that you ever generate or perform.  It's a continuous
real-time alibi recorder.  It's a voluntary submission of every
second of existence to information overload.  It's a system that can
show you all the photos you were ever in, tell you exactly how many
phonecalls you've ever made, or retrieve an mpeg of you going to the
toilet in March, 1986:
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993084

Also: we knew that modern innovation was roaring ahead at a
blistering pace, but can MyLifeBits really allow ""time-shifting""?

might just lead, check out this wonderful piece of short science

perspective Flash games (e.g. suicide bombers at

bereft of imagination as the gameplay is of taste, it's 'Pedestrian

We Irish are sometimes so uncultured, compared to our continental
cousins - even in things you'd expect us to be good at, like
vandalism.  Here we get inarticulate clowns with cans of red paint
daubing ""666"" on the gates of Cardinal Connell's palatial Drumcondra
residence... whereas in Paris, to pick an example out of the blue,
egghead situationists sneakily attach absurdist plaques (e.g. ""On
April 17, 1967, nothing happened here"") onto public buildings:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2478161.stm

*

Microsoft have co-opted the AmIHotOrNot concept, as is their wont, mixed
it up with a bit of Miss World, and come up with the 'Microsoft Office v.
X Integrated Experience', or Ms. M.o.X.i.e. competition:
http://www.microsoft.com/mac/officex/contests/votemain.asp
Was it for this Emily Wilding Davison died beneath King George V's horse?

never happened.

LEGACY MEDIA.................There Was Nothing In The Air That Night

IRISH TV: If you rush straight home from work after reading this on
Thursday, you might catch the second semi-final of corny but
challenging elimination quiz IT'S NOT THE ANSWER (RTE1, 17:30).
Come on the beardy guy!  The final's on at the same time tomorrow.
Calm down from all that excitement with the laughable one-hour FAIR
CITY murder trial special (RTE1, 20:00) - it's quite brilliant how
the risible scripts really bring out the absolute worst in truly
terrible actors.  Settle down with a few G&Ts to watch PRIME TIME on
the same channel at 21:30, where they're discussing Ireland's
alcoholic epidemic and its attendant social problems, or waste them
on either the bottom-scraping POLICE ACADEMY 3 (N2, 21:30) or the
geriatric 1978 blockbuster COMA (TG4, 22:05).

Friday night, and after a hard day of buying nothing you can flop in
front of creepy Hitler doco SIX MOST EVIL MEN (N2, 21:00).  Near as
we can tell, the other evil men are Macauley Culkin in UNCLE BUCK
(TV3, 20:00), gossip columnist WINCHELL in a solid eponymous biopic
(N2, 21:30), the big boss bad guy - is it Kang? Kane? Cowen? - in
MORTAL KOMBAT (TG4, 21:25), Mel Gibson in predictable 80s drug
thriller TEQUILA SUNRISE (RTE1, 23:50), and Quentin Tarantino
jumping on his own bandwagon in DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO (TV3,
0:50).  Hang on, Dave Fanning might be one of the evil men too: he's
presenting THE LAST BROADCAST on Network 2 at 23:35.

Battered stocks regain ground
Led by a surge in chip titan Intel, beaten-down technology shares rose Thursday.
Despite a Merrill Lynch downgrade of Yahoo to ""reduce/sell"", the Internet portal rose after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results and also helped lift the sector. CNET's Tech index gained 29.87 points, or 3.11 percent, to close at 995.16. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index tacked on 28.42 points, or 2.11 percent, to close at 1,374.43--after hitting a five-year low Wednesday.
Broader markets were mixed amid news wholesale prices rose slightly and drug firm Bristol-Myers Squibb is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.0 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 8,801.5. The S&P 500 added 6.9 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 927.37, after it too reached a five-year low Wednesday.
With rebates, HP angles for PC sales
Hewlett-Packard is trying to beat the heat with summer deals on PCs.
For retail buyers in the United States, the company is offering several new rebate or promotional programs, designed to stimulate demand for its PCs, going into the back-to-school shopping season. Some of the deals include a new $200 mail-in rebate on desktops, while others offer instant $50 rebates.

Shareholders sue PayPal, eBay
The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.

SAP cuts forecast, shows Q2 loss
Europe's biggest software maker, SAP AG, shocked the market on Thursday by unexpectedly cutting its sales forecast and missing analysts' forecast for the second quarter.

The company said it would post a net loss of 235 million euros ($232 million) and said it was taking a non-recurring accounting charge of 414 million euros to cover impairments of minority investments in the United States, including a 318 million euros charge from its 20 percent stake in Commerce One.

Merrill Lynch downgrades Yahoo in report 7/11/02
Analysts Justin Baldauf and Tim Gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on the Internet giant from ""neutral"" to ""reduce/sell"" and their long-term rating from ""strong buy"" to ""neutral"" after seeing Yahoo's second-quarter results. Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension. Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say. They argue Yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's fundamentals.

Hi Everyone,
There seem to be several ""boneheads"" in our class. A few months ago I 
ran into John Dahill, he asked me if I would go to the reunion picnic 
with him. His girlfriend and my guyfriend wouldn't know anyone there, 
so I said yes. Yesterday he told me he can't go!! All this time he 
thought it was on Saturday!! Oh well, I will see everyone there 
sometime through the afternoon.

When reviewing the  shiba Pocket PC e740, I spent a lot of time trying to understand its XScale processor. A benchmark provided by Intel seems to indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous Pocket PCs, but in hands-on use we didn't find any significant difference in performance. I'm still not certain whether I should attribute performance limitation to the operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications (which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that much better than the old StrongARM. But regardless, the e740 is an exceptional Pocket PC and one I don't hesitate to recommend to those looking for a high-powered PDA.

CNET | DOWNLOAD DISPATCH(Mac Edition)

Using a Mac and today's music software, musicians are finding
that they can create, record, and master their songs without
the need to pay for expensive studio time. Deck, our Pick of
the Week, offers a multitrack audio workstation that can take 
care of all your recording needs, and it's even optimized for 
OS X. Not just great for music, Deck can be used for film, video,
and numerous other applications. Get on Deck:

Also this week, we've got Captain FTP, for an easy way to
transfer files; AquilaCalendar, to get you organized under OS X;
Tex-Edit Plus, a full-featured alternative to the pricier
text editors; and Boom, a remake of one of the great classic
arcade games.

Enjoy!

   DECK
   Version: 3.5

   License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X

   Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation
   under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most
   attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty
   editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,
   film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big
   brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process
   soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record
   ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and
   up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music
   production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind
   to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen. You're on
   Deck:

   CAPTAIN FTP
   Version: 1.3
   File size: 793K
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X

   Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain
   FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and
   downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes
   full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,
   you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like
   without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The
   program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming
   interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address
   book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves
   awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:

   AQUILACALENDAR
   Version: 1.19
   File size: 1.63MB
   License: Free to try; $20.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X

   One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
   organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
   keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more.  -do lists
   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
   organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:

   you check out Tex-Edit Plus. This handy little editor offers
   all the basics like unlimited Undo and Redo commands,
   translucent drag-and-drop capabilities, several text styles,
   and the option to highlight selected text. Also, you'll be
   able to use it to act as a text editor for an FTP client
   such as Fetch, Interarchy, NetFinder, or Transmit. Text

   Remember the classic arcade game Bomberman? Even if you
   don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a
   spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while
   setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll
   also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear
   of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through
   eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10
   subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came
   from. Blast away:

* Judge Grants Consumer Voice in ReplayTV Lawsuit

  Hollywood Tries to Skip Over Consumers' Concerns

Los Angeles - Judge Florence Cooper today granted five ReplayTV owners
a voice in the court debate over their rights to record television
programs and to skip commercials using digital video recorders (DVRs).
The federal court denied the entertainment industry motion to dismiss
the ReplayTV owners' lawsuit and agreed to combine the consumer
lawsuit with an entertainment industry lawsuit filed last fall to ban
ReplayTV DVRs.

""We're pleased the court has recognized that the debate about digital
video recorders must include the customers who purchase and use the
devices,"" said Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Intellectual
Property Attorney Robin Gross.

""[T]he issue of whether the Newmark Plaintiffs' use of the ReplayTV
DVRs' send-show and commercial-skipping features constitutes fair use
will most likely figure prominently in both the ReplayTV action and
the Newmark action,"" wrote Judge Cooper in her opinion.

Responding to the entertainment industry's lawsuit against DVR
manufacturers, EFF petitioned the court on behalf of the five ReplayTV
owners to declare legal their use of the digital devices also known as
personal video recorders (PVRs). EFF seeks to ensure that the legal
debate over DVRs will include consumers' concerns along with those of
the entertainment and consumer electronics industries.

The entertainment industry claims that commercial skipping infringes
copyright and digital recording aids piracy.

""I'm not a crook if I skip commercials or share a news interview of
myself with my mom using the SendShow feature rather than sending her
a videotape,"" said Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist.org and a
ReplayTV owner. ""I shouldn't have to worry about getting prosecuted,
but the Turner Broadcasting CEO tells us that taking a bathroom break
is criminal. We even have Senators urging Attorney General Ashcroft to
prosecute people who share files.""

Along with Newmark, ReplayTV customers filing the lawsuit with legal
representation by the EFF are: Keith Ogden, owner of a financial
broker firm in San Francisco; Shawn Hughes, a small business owner in
Georgia; Seattle journalist Glenn Fleishman; and southern Californian
video engineer Phil Wright.

* Musician Disputes Industry's Stance on Music Sharing

  Janis Ian Urges Artists Speak Out, Support Free Downloads

San Francisco - Grammy-winning songwriter and recording artist Janis
Ian today challenged the music industry by celebrating peer-to-peer
(P2P) music sharing as a boon to musicians.

Ian, who is in the San Francisco Bay Area as part of her current
concert tour, recently published ""The Internet Debacle,"" a pointed
critique of the music industry's disregard for musicians and consumers
who want to distribute and acquire music online. The Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) applauds Ian's actions and hopes that others
will see the Internet as an aid, not a threat, to musicians.

In the article, Ian assails the major record labels' argument that P2P
file-sharing is harming artists.

""Free Internet downloads are good for the music industry and its
artists,"" explains Ian. ""Every act that can't get signed to a major,
for whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners,
enticing them to buy the CD and come to the concerts.""

She adds that during the heyday of Napster she saw a marked increase
in CD sales from her website. She attacks technological and political
measures meant to harm consumers by restricting their right to copy
and back up their legally purchased music.

Ian will play on August 17 in San Rafael, CA.

During her 17 album career, Ian has earned nine Grammy nominations and
three awards. Her best known songs include 1967's ""Society's Child""
and 1975's ""At Seventeen."" More recently, her 1993 album ""Breaking
Silence"" was nominated for a Grammy Award as Contemporary Folk Album
of the Year. Her songs have been recorded by artists ranging from
Bette Midler to Cher, from Glen Campbell to Vanilla Fudge, and from
Joan Baez to Etta James.

* Court Hearing Set in DeCSS Publication Jurisdiction Case

On September 5, 2002, the California Supreme Court will hear oral
arguments about whether a California court has jurisdiction over
Matthew Pavlovich, an Indiana college student who is a resident of
Texas, for his hosting of an Internet mailing list. Pavlovich
maintained the mailing list for the LiVid programming group, which
provides a unified development and user resource center for video and
DVD-related work for the Linux operating system. One of the group's
projects was to create a DVD player for computer systems that run
Linux. As part of that effort, DeCSS, a program that decrypts the copy
protection on DVDs, was published on the group's mailing list. The
entertainment industry has sued Pavlovich in California court, and
last year a California appellate court ruled Pavlovich was within the
state court's jurisdiction since he published information that relates
to the entertainment industry, which is based in California.

EFF and Pavlovich's legal team argue that Pavlovich is outside of
California's jurisdiction since he was a college student in Indiana
with no contacts to California when DeCSS was published on the LiVid
list. The hearing on September 5 will take place in San Francisco.

Enterprise Java Education Strategies
Floyd Marinescu to co-teach J2EE Patterns - Sept 16, Dallas
Dear TSS Members,
I thought you'd be interested to know that The Middleware Company has created a J2EE Patterns training course that I will be co-teaching in Dallas during the week of September 16th. The course combines and improves upon the best J2EE design patterns material available in my book EJB Design Patterns, Sun's Core Patterns, TheServerSide's patterns repository and others.
I have just reviewed the final material and I am very excited with the end product. This class takes an indepth look at all the most important patterns today, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. One of the cool things about the course is that it shows you how the patterns were implemented in a variety of popular open source frameworks and production applications, including TheServerSide.com.
I highly recommend this course to the seasoned J2EE developer who wants to master the cutting edge in J2EE architecture and design.
If you'd like to register for the course, simply click here:

iXML Pattern
By Venkatesh Balakumar
In due course, we will be finding ourselves in the middle of Web services, which will granulate into representing all data in XML. For preparing and implementing Web services, it's necessary to express all data in XML. This pattern does the same.

Widget Pages

This pattern allows for using XMLC and Barracuda without exposing their APIs to widget users. In fact it allows for transparently using more than one widget implementation at the same time, which is ideal for migrating or upgrading.

JRun 4.0 - Good Stuff
By Jason McKerr
Some general impressions I had of JRun: It's very easy to get it up and running.  
Allaire-now-Macromedia has always had one of my favorite servlet engines. 
The Java Management Console (web-based admin interface) has gotten a tonne better.  
It's dead easy to plug into just about any IDE (I've done it with JBuilder Enterprise 6, and the Intellij IDEA EAP (Builds 640 -642). 
The JSP compiler is smokin! Very, very fast. I think it must come with Jikes or something.

Java Server Faces Public Draft and Early Access Available
The public draft of the JavaServer Faces 1.0 Specification has been published, as well as an early access download of the API's and tag library. JSF is a web application framework that reduces the amount of code needed to write a web front end. Developers need only write JSF components and corresponding event handling code, the framework then simplifies the tasks of validation, request parameter parsing, state management, multipe clients support, etc.

Meta Group: J2EE Complexity Holding Back Platform Adoption
The Meta Group has released a research report saying that the relative complexity of doing server-side development using J2EE is hurting adoption of the platform. Among other predictions are the continuing dominance of BEA and IBM, more consolidation, and increasing vendor competition in tools and frameworks.

Dear Reader,
Hard-drive-based MP3 players, which allow you to store massive 
amounts of MP3s and other files on a portable device, have been 
around for a few years. But recently, three new players have 
taken the concept to a new high with impressive advancements 
in design, functionality, and interface. Each has its unique 
strong points, but they're all groundbreaking in their own way. 
Check out our hands-on reviews.

Through daily use I've found that
Mozilla
and
Opera
Web browsers beat Internet Explorer because of two features: tabbed windows and built-in pop-up killers. But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last couple of years, Web builders have used
proprietary code
from Microsoft in their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.
I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem. Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors.   solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as
Secure IE
to get the kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both worlds.
Who do you think should be solving problems of Web site incompatibility: Web builders, users, or browser manufacturers? Let me know at

Last week I asked whether Audiogalaxy could survive only offering non-infringing files. Here are a few of your answers:
""Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!""
Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster.
""Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear.""
But some people always find a silver lining.
""I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches.""
A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me.
""I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine.""
I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea.
""It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like Audiogalaxy.""
With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work.

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday 
when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac 
from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat 
hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything, 
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where 
there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past 
past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I 
fry?
As it turns out, it was another case of ""always check the 
small stuff"". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to 
the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't 
dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that 
I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the 
cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM 
switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling, 
the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a 
tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning 
message like every other computer on the planet, I can only 
attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running 
Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The 
penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How 
appropriate...

Windows XP Security Checklist
Finely crafted by Bernie Klinder
http://www.labmice.net/articles/winxpsecuritychecklist.htm
With all of the security features crammed into Windows XP, 
where does one start? Do you need VPN capability? Is NTFS an 
appropriate file system choice for you? Is there any value 
at all in Simple File Sharing? After much hounding, Bernie 
Klinder has drawn up a healthy checklist of things you need 
to address under Windows XP in order to maintain a system 
that is both security and compatible with the rest of your 
computing world.

ATI Still Makes Video Cards?
http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656
Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have 
something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card 
market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the 
majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe 
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from 
what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based 
cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just 
yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re-
entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their 
driver development has improved as much as their hardware 
seems to have.

Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.

Yer Kidding... Really?
http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html
I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us 
that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with 
math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and 
personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's 
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of 
Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do 
some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or 
three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last, 
Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to 
point out that they have much more to offer than Linux, 
which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when 
you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one 
another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained 
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, 
requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here 
and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed 
configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use 
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a 
replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder.

Core Java Technologies Technical Tips
View this issue as simple text
September 10, 2002
In this Issue
WELCOME to the Core Java
TM
Technologies Tech Tips, September 10, 2002. Here you'll get tips on using core Java technologies and APIs, such as those in Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE
TM
).
Using ArrayList and LinkedList
Using Zero-Length Arrays
These tips were developed using Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4.
This issue of the JDC Tech Tips is written by Glen McCluskey.
USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST
ArrayList
and
LinkedList
are two
Collections
classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an
ArrayList
of Strings, or a
LinkedList
of Integers. This tip compares the performance of
ArrayList
and
LinkedList
, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.
The first key point is that an
ArrayList
is backed by a primitive
Object
array. Because of that, an
ArrayList
is much faster than a
LinkedList
for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the
get
method. Note that the
get
method is implemented for
LinkedLists
, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a
LinkedList
, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.
Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an
ArrayList
or a
LinkedList
. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.
Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an
ArrayList
or a
LinkedList
:
import java.util.*;

    public class ListDemo1 {
        static final int N = 10000;

        static List values;

        // make List of increasing Integer values

        static {
           Integer vals[] = new Integer[N];

           Random rn = new Random();

           for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i < N; i++) {
               vals[i] = new Integer(currval);
               currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
           }

           values = Arrays.asList(vals);
        }
        
        // iterate across a list and look up every
        // value in the list using binary search

        static long timeList(List lst) {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {

               // look up a value in the list 
               // using binary search

               int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                   lst, values.get(i));

               // sanity check for result 
               // of binary search

               if (indx != i) {
                   System.out.println(
                                    ""*** error ***\n"");
               }
           }

           return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
       }

       public static void main(String args[]) {

           // do lookups in an ArrayList 

           System.out.println(""time for ArrayList = "" +
               timeList(new ArrayList(values)));

           // do lookups in a LinkedList

           System.out.println(
               ""time for LinkedList = "" +
               timeList(new LinkedList(values)));
       }
    }
The
ListDemo1
program sets up a
List
of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an
ArrayList
or a
LinkedList
. Then
Collections.binarySearch
is used to search for each value in the 
list.
When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this:
time for ArrayList = 31

    time for LinkedList = 4640
ArrayList
is about 150 times faster than
LinkedList
. (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for
ArrayList
as compared to that for
LinkedList
. The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly,
LinkedList
is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and
LinkedList
does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a
LinkedList
is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an
ArrayList
has a fixed time.
You can use the
RandomAccess
marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access:
void f(List lst) {
        if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) {
            // supports fast random access
        }
    }
ArrayList
implements the
RandomAccess
interface, and
LinkedList
. does not. Note that
Collections.binarySearch
does take advantage of the
RandomAccess
property, to optimize searches.
Do these results prove that
ArrayList
is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where
LinkedList
does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for
LinkedList
. An example is reversing a
LinkedList
using
Collections.reverse
. The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators.
Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case,
LinkedList
is the better choice.   demonstrate that, consider the following ""worst case"" scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this:
import java.util.*;

    public class ListDemo2 {
        static final int N = 50000;

        // time how long it takes to add 
        // N objects to a list

        static long timeList(List lst) {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

            Object obj = new Object();

            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                lst.add(0, obj);
            }

            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }

        public static void main(String args[]) {

            // do timing for ArrayList

            System.out.println(
                ""time for ArrayList = "" +
                timeList(new ArrayList()));

            // do timing for LinkedList

            System.out.println(
                ""time for LinkedList = "" +
                timeList(new LinkedList()));
        }
    }
When you run this program, the result should look something like this:
time for ArrayList = 4859

    time for LinkedList = 125
These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example.
When an element is added to the beginning of an
ArrayList
, all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a
LinkedList
simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a
LinkedList
has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an
ArrayList
has a cost that's proportional to the list size.
So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how
ArrayList
and
LinkedList
are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally.
The
LinkedList
class has a private internal class defined like this:
private static class Entry {
        Object element;
        Entry next;
        Entry previous;
    }
Each
Entry
object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the
LinkedList
-- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A
LinkedList
of 1000 elements will have 1000
Entry
objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a
LinkedList
structure, given all these
Entry
objects.
An
ArrayList
has a backing
Object
array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as:
newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1;
Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an
ArrayList
with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way
ArrayList
works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space.
If you know how many elements will be in an
ArrayList
, you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the
trim Size
method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space.
So far, this discussion has assumed that either an
ArrayList
or a
LinkedList
is ""right"" for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key.
You could store the pairs in an N x 2
Object
array.   find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists.
Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of
ArrayLists
, and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a
HashMap
.
Which is faster, a binary search on an
ArrayList
, or a
HashMap
? Here's a final example that compares these two:
import java.util.*;

    public class ListDemo3 {
        static final int N = 500000;

        // Lists of keys and values

        static List keys;
        static List values;

        // fill the keys list with ascending order key 
        // values and fill the values list with
        // corresponding values (-key)

        static {
            Integer keyvec[] = new Integer[N];
            Integer valuevec[] = new Integer[N];

            Random rn = new Random();

            for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i < N; i++) {
                keyvec[i] = new Integer(currval);
                valuevec[i] = new Integer(-currval);
                currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
            }

            keys = Arrays.asList(keyvec);
            values = Arrays.asList(valuevec);
        }

        // fill a Map with key/value pairs

        static Map map = new HashMap();

        static {
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i));
            }
        }

        // do binary search lookup of all keys

        static long timeList() {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                    keys, keys.get(i));

                // sanity check of returned value 
                // from binary search

                if (indx != i) {
                    System.out.println(
                                    ""*** error ***\n"");
                }
            }

            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }

        // do Map lookup of all keys

        static long timeMap() {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                Integer value = (Integer)map.get(
                                          keys.get(i));

                // sanity check of value returned 
                // from map lookup

                if (value != values.get(i)) {
                    System.out.println(
                                    ""*** error ***\n"");
                }
            }

            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }

        public static void main(String args[]) {

            // do timing for List implementation

            System.out.println(""List time = "" + 
                                           timeList());

            // do timing for Map implementation

            System.out.println(""Map time = "" + 
                                            timeMap());
        }
    }
The program sets up
Lists
of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table.
When you run the
ListDemo3
program, you should get a result that looks something like this:
ArrayList time = 1000

    HashMap time = 281
In this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the
ArrayList
will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case.
However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs.
Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip:
Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both
ArrayList
and
LinkedList.
For
ArrayList
, appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For
LinkedList
, the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal
Entry
object.
Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an
ArrayList
implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a
LinkedList
has fixed cost.
A
LinkedList
does not support efficient random access
An
ArrayList
has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A
LinkedList
has significant space overhead per element.
Sometimes a
Map
structure is a better choice than a
List
.

USING ZERO-LENGTH ARRAYS
Suppose that you are writing a Java application that involves some sort of data filtering. You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates ""outliers,"" that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data.
How could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here's one approach:
import java.util.*;
    
    public class ZeroDemo1 {
    
        // filter input array and throw away values 
        // that are less than minval or greater than 
        // maxval
    
        static int[] filterData(
                int indata[], int minval, int maxval) {
    
            // check parameters for errors 
    
            if (indata == null) {
                throw new NullPointerException(
                                     ""indata is null"");
            }
            if (maxval < minval) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                ""maxval < minval"");
            }
    
            // count number of valid values 
            // in input array
    
            int validcnt = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < indata.length; i++) {
                if (indata[i] >= minval && indata[i] 
                                         <= maxval) {
                    validcnt++;
                }
            }
    
            // if no valid values, return null
    
            if (validcnt == 0) {
                return null;
            }
    
            // copy valid values to new array 
            // and return it
    
            int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
            for (int i = 0, j = 0; 
                              i < indata.length; i++) {
                if (indata[i] >= minval && indata[i] 
                                           <= maxval) {
                    outdata[j++] = indata[i];
                }
            }
            return outdata;
        }
    
        public static void main(String args[]) {
    
            // set up test array of integers
    
            int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59};
    
            // filter out values not in the range 1-10
    
            int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10);
            for (int i = 0; i < outdata1.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(outdata1[i]);
            }
    
            // filter out values not 
            // in the range 100-200
    
            int outdata2[] = filterData(
                                     indata, 100, 200);
            for (int i = 0; i < outdata2.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(outdata2[i]);
            }
        }
    }
The
filterData
method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference.
The result of running the
ZeroDemo1
program is:
1
    3
    8
    Exception in thread ""main""
    java.lang.NullPointerException
        at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72)
The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of
filterData
returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account.
A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values:
/*
    if (validcnt == 0) {
        return null;
    }
    */
When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated:
int outdata[] = new int[0];
This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length.
For the
ZeroDemo1
example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this:
int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
    if (validcnt == 0) {
        return outdata;
    }
Note that usage such as:
int outdata[] = new int[]{};
is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants.
In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows:
private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = 
                                            new int[0];
This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application.
There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example:
import java.util.*;
    
    public class ZeroDemo2 {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
    
            // set up ArrayList and add strings to it
    
            List stringlist = new ArrayList();
            stringlist.add(""string 1"");
            stringlist.add(""string 2"");
            stringlist.add(""string 3"");
    
            // convert to String array
    
            String out[] = (
                          String[])stringlist.toArray(
            new String[0]);
            for (int i = 0; i < out.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(out[i]);
            }
        }
    }
The result of running the
ZeroDemo2
program is:
string 1
    string 2
    string 3
The
ZeroDemo2
program sets up an
ArrayList
, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls
toArray
to get a
String
array of the three elements in the
ArrayList
. In this example, the argument to
toArray
is ""new String[0]"". This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a
String
array that's big enough to hold the elements of the
ArrayList
, you can specify it as the argument to
toArray
. The method will use the
String
array.
But if your array is not big enough, then the
toArray
method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array.
ArrayList
stores its element references in an
Object
array. The
toArray
method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (
java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance
) to create an array of the appropriate type.

PRESS RELEASE FROM THE AYN RAND INSTITUTE
2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
Irvine CA 92606

July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET

       IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.

       ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest.""

       ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction.

       ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""

       ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free.""

For almost a year, we've been working on a new effort that we're
finally ready to show you. We're proud to introduce our new Apparel
and Accessories store with over 400 major clothing brands (including
Gap, Old Navy, Nordstrom, Lands' End, Target, Eddie Bauer, Foot
Locker, and many more).

Our goal is to provide complete apparel selection and offer it the
Amazon way�-with easy navigation, a single shopping cart, your
shipping and payment information already on file, etc. Of course, none
of this would be possible without our many apparel store partners
(we're thankful to have such an amazing group of companies working
with us).

We released a beta version of the Apparel store about a week ago, and
much to our surprise, tens of thousands of clothing and accessory
items have already been ordered. Through the first few days of our
beta, customers have ordered:

* 14,487 shirts (Polo Ralph Lauren button-downs to DKNY blouses)

* 1,843 jackets (Old Navy fleece to Polartec windbreakers)

* 2,712 sweaters (Eddie Bauer V-necks to Liz Claiborne cardigans)

* 140 swimsuits ( mmy Bahama to Speedo)

* 9,408 pants (Gap khakis to Guess jeans)

* 485 skirts (Nordstrom suede to Spiegel leather)

* 1,461 sleepwear items (Marshall Field's satin robes to Lands' End
  flannel pajamas)

* 3,254 pairs of shoes (Nike Air Max to Nine West boots)

* 1,870 pairs of socks (Cole Haan cashmere-blend to OshKosh B'Gosh
  cotton)

* 2,805 accessories (handbags, watches, scarves, etc.)

* 3,287 pairs of underwear (Jockey briefs to Hugo Boss boxers). We all
  need clean underwear, right?

We hope you'll check it out. You'll get a $30 promotional certificate
when you spend $50 or more in the new Apparel store (see details
below). We'd especially appreciate any feedback you have (please
reply to this email to share your thoughts).

1,text/plain,None,1,0,0,0,org,0,0,0,7,1,2,1,1,"Securing multiple virtual hosts: 

I am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.
We are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are
merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.
We are not running any secure applications on the root host.

I have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate
requests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's
grasp of the commands and command line options.


My questions are:

1.  Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure
virtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each
of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure?

2.  Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I
correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body
of httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host
in the <Virtual . . .> section of httpsd.conf?  This sort of assumes the
answer to 1. is  - you need a CA for each virtual host.

3.  Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our
users, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server
certificate for the virtual hosts?  Wouldn't a client certificate only be
necessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity?  Would that be
a good idea given our scenario?

Thanks in advance for your help.

  fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
      Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
        eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.

William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
alike.

Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
political ties).

Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
have also been the subject of much speculation over the
years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
created in the mind of the bard.

Being that I have a print subscription to PocketPC Magazine, 
I haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when 
Hal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery 
method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a 
spin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the
Digital 
Edition
and see if you like reading the mag in that 
format better than the print variety. A Software and 
Accessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my 
last belated visit.
I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but 
not for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as 
an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. 
Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and 
it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the 
Compaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more 
pleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to 
the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass 
levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my 
opinion.

LDAP Whodunit
Pondered by Warren Dugas
""Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?""
History of LDAP
http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp
X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a 
comprehensive Directory Service, including an information 
model, namespace, functional model, and authentication 
framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol 
(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full 
OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of 
which is not used by most applications.
DAP is significantly more complicated than the more 
prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more 
code and computing horsepower to run. The size and 
complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, 
such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality 
often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are 
cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of 
X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, 
with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed 
a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough 
when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running 
the Windows� operating system or the Macintosh.
The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March 
of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as 
rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories 
(ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April 
of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and 
Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in 
their Directory Services products in order that they may in 
turn operate with each other and integrate with the 
Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts 
but at this time is not finished.

Looking for Sound
Suggested by Corey Hollett
http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp
http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html
""I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best 
sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My 
criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd 
playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong 
point.""
Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two 
respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of 
the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. 
Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle 
Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards 
and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle 
Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice.
His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings 
on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 
2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system 
was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me 
when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the 
dust. The above review that Corey pointed out hits the high 
points, and is actually quite in-depth for an ""initial"" 
review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a 
more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

QuickTime 6 Released
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the 
licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way 
for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only 
addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite 
among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 
5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag 
along. As always, there is a standard free version available 
for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, 
such as full screen video playback, the ability to create 
MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free 
player.

Microtel & WalMart Love Linux
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html
WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. 
They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall 
LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through 
WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give 
potential Linux users an easier way to get started without 
having to build their own system from scratch or deal with 
driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A 
Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little 
as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

On The Way to Telluride, On My Way Back to the World

8/29/02

Dear friends,

I go to turn my computer on but I have forgotten where the on/off switch
is. I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven't turned it on for
the past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I
find it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads ""fatal
error"" and offers to ""save"" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a
few weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.
Gone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters
but everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?
When will this pain stop? 

I got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival
is screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the
United States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always
so proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where
my memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last
winter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the
room, catching a scene here and there, saying, ""Boy, that's something,
isn't it!"" 

I don't feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two
months. I can't conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no
matter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it
will be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my
sadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the
other way around. At my family's insistence, I tried going on TV a few
weeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had
decided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so
empty and more alone. I had agreed to go on ""Crossfire"" and Donahue (thank
God for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of
those stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no
one can hear (or wants to hear) what's being said. 

They agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about
aren't my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist
country, I just sat there for a moment and didn't respond. I thought I
would just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -
but then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and
smiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I
intend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any
other nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the
majority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob 'cause
we're going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC
for a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that
numerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob
Novak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said
that capitalism is a ""sin.""

My dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive
with him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he
told me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going
to college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had
a secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to
be counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil
filter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave
us all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most. 

                      *        *       *       *       *        *

Dad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom
would have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how
happy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey
in my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the
screening of ""Roger & Me"" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I
got to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,
and how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how
I stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause
and more. 

It's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF
selection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.
""Politics,"" is what I have been told.  o ""populist"" for the new elite who
now sit in judgment of what is art. ""They don't want to help further your
platform Mike,"" a person close to the committee tells me. ""One of them even
said, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally
want to contribute to its popularity.'""  So, it was decided that ""Bowling
for Columbine,"" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as
""one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,"" a film chosen
by every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film
must not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room
where we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I've gone too far this
time, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong -
right straight through the heart of an America that is both master and
victim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will
always remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos
who, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a
once great art form.

                     *      *      *      *      *      *      *

My dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside
just as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for
inspection. They don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I
might have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right
people, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the
next round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,
and he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in
the middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell
him I'll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through
security and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back
and see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad.

I'm on the plane and I'm thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag
when I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting
untouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to
rush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight
bag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night
and day I sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live,
holding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair
on my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran
uncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had
an 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said
the chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!
I've had those odds! I won! Don't let her die! Please do everything you can
do! Don't let her die.

The priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad
asked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our
goodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I
am sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can't see the
screen through the tears...maybe someday...)

The night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise
planned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to
show it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what
she has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad's in
that list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever
mattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,
the way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being
thankful for.

I never got to show her the movie that night. ""Mike!"" she called out from
the porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. ""Get your father! I don't
feel good."" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be
gone.

                 *          *          *          *          *          *

I'm walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to
Denver, and I hear someone say, ""OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!"" I
turn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I
apologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at
the Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her
eyes. ""My mom died in October,"" she says, and I realize that this pain that
feels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No
one is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me
about how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how
is my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She
gives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At
that moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this
year-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in
this, and so I ask her how she is doing. ""I think a lot,"" she says, ""about
all the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I
believe she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it
all.""

They call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see
if he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got
talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother
getting cancer and how she was caring for her. ""She said that her bill in
the hospital came to $60,000,"" he says with astonishment. ""They won't be
able to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave
her a tip along with the toll.""

""You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?""

""Well, you have to. That person could be you or me.""

That is my father. That was my mother. 

Yours, 

Michael Moore

PS. Thank you, all of you, who sent me your condolences and who contributed
to the local poverty program in my mother's name. I was so moved by your
generosity and by your words of love and kindness. It will never be
forgotten.

Copies, Webcasts tangled in draft bill
Legislators are readying a bill that could sharply limit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows, and transferring files through the Internet.
At the same time, the draft legislation seen by CNET News.com would place the struggling Webcasting industry on firmer legal footing.

Sharp's Zaurus PDA suffers security holes
Sharp's Linux-based, business-oriented Zaurus handheld suffers from security holes that could let hackers grab private data off a corporate network, according to researchers at Syracuse University.
In an advisory posted Wednesday to a Syracuse University computer-science Web site, researchers said they had found vulnerabilities in Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 and Zaurus SL-5000D handhelds. The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system, giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be input through the keypad or touch screen.

Outlook plug-in could let the hackers in
A widely used plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack.
Security company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Network Associates released a patch for the problem Wednesday as well.

ACLU: Don't rat out your customers
A clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small Internet service providers to get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous critics.
A group including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Center for Democracy and Technology is urging ISPs to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called John Doe legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously air their companies' dirty laundry. The group has sent letters to more than 100 ISPs, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers know if they're targets.

Shareholders sue PayPal, eBay
The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.

Ellison: I don't need an understudy
Deflecting continuing calls for a No. 2 executive, Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said again Wednesday that the company does not need anyone to back him up.
Ellison, responding primarily to recent news stories that the company might need a second in command, said the current team is enough to guide Oracle.

ASK THE FOOL

Q. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. 
I ALREADY HAVE 
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW 
CAN I STOP IT? 

A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and 
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to 
be removed from junk mail (er, ""direct mail"") lists and 
telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request. 

Full Answer:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562069

-----------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR MONEY 

RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070

Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 

1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 

2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072

3. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073

4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more 
to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074

5. REFINANCE AND SAVE 
When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity 
to save big money.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562075

If this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it 
alone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your 
finances with TMF Money Advisor. In fact, we're so excited about 
this service, we are offering a free one-month trial 
subscription. For more information, go here. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562076

Independence, visit our Personal Finance area.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SPOTLIGHT

SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. 

We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.

Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging.   figure 
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
nifty Savings Center. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562078

-----------------------------------------------------------------
COMMUNITY TIPS

DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. 

-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. 

-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. 

-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. 

-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.

-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. 

-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). 

Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

Moore: Speech recognition next hurdle
Speech recognition will be the next transforming technology, but that transformation 
may take another 50 years, says Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. Honored this week with 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Moore took time to talk about the slowing down of 
his well-known law, the economy, philanthropic priorities, and more.

Tech shores up Homeland Defense
Computer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President Bush's 
proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed the department 
last month, he never mentioned the Internet or cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill 
scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about
tech-savvy terrorists
--and 
insisting any new agency must shield the U.S. from
electronic attacks
as well.

I had just finished giving
Ben
and his sister a ""behind
the scenes"" look at our set, when Patrick walked in and poked me
in the left arm repeatedly with his index finger - until I hung up
the phone and gave him my full, undivided attention. ""Did you know
that your Gnome mes are being featured in the 'Barnes & Noble'
eBooks section,"" he asked. Well, that was news to me. After
flailing over to his workstation and flipping through a few pages,
we ultimately realized that he had discovered the entry on the
main page for
Amazon's
eBooks
. Cool! ""With a name that inspires curiosity and sparks the imagination,
Lockergnome represents one of the latest and most popular
additions to our e-documents catalog. At prices starting under $3,
these eminently useful titles from one of the most fanciful-sounding
publishers we've encountered are hard to resist."" Thank
you for helping us along, gang. My ultimate goal is to kick that
Godin guy out of the top ten - if only for a day.

I must now thank both Lockergnomie Dan Reain and Nancy Workman-Luter
(both from Sonic Foundry) for donating a couple more prizes
for this year's
Gnomedex
conference
. Just by walking through the entrance with your
pass in hand, you'll be automatically entered to win one of the
copies of Sound Forge XP! And this software is no slouch; for home
users and professionals on a Windows OS, it's one of the best
audio editors around. If it can't do something you need to have
done, then I bet it can't be done at all. Expect a full
Lockergnome review from our Digital Media editor (Jake) at some
point in the future. Until then, feel free to
download
the demo
. If I can ever decide on a digital video camera,
perhaps their Vegas Video will sit on my system, too. Melanie and
I were talking about hardware options the other day. She's leaning
towards a Canon, too. Unless I hear or see otherwise, the ZR45MC
is at the top of my list. Still and low-light images aren't the
best, but I'm not really up for spending much more than $1000.
Neither is Gretchen, oddly enough.
As much as I dislike the AOL client user interface, I gotta admit:
it's pretty darn powerful underneath. For instance, you can
""unsend"" an e-mail message (but only if it was sent to another
America Online member and s/he hasn't read it yet). If you travel
often, the service is a bargain. If you know someone who just
needs the Internet basics, it's perfect. One caveat: the software
puts RealPlayer on your system without asking you first. I was a
little upset when I discovered its icon sitting in my Start Menu.
Nowhere during the installation process did I see a way to opt out
of it. I'm not surprised; there are more advertisements on AOL
than there are from your average ""free"" Web page host. You may
have asked yourself: ""What is Chris doing installing AOL in the
first place?!"" I don't
blame
you
. No, hell did not freeze over. We've been doing tips for
their users on our show lately, and I decided to throw it on my
laptop for testing purposes. Perhaps 8.0 will be better?

SEPopular v1.02 [2.4M] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.monocle-solutions.com/sepopular/sepopular.shtml
{Popularity contest} I never considered myself to be part of the popular crowd. But how do you really know if others consider you to be popular? Well, if you are talking about the popularity of your website (although the junior high kids are more concerned about the labels on your clothes), then all you have to do is download SEPopular. Search engines (such as Google) rank your site by determining how many people link to your site (the more people who link to your site, the better your ranking). With this investigative tool, you can see how many links to your website there are (from the perspective of five major search engines). You don't just have to check out your own website, though... all you have to do is enter the URL of a website, and out comes the TRUTH about its popularity. Another nice feature of this software is that you can import web addresses from a .txt file so that you don't have to enter each one individually. It's all about keeping up with thejoneses.com.

{Measure distance and angles} I was never very good in geometry... Pythagoras would be disappointed that I can never exactly remember his theorem. (What did a hippopotamus have to do with triangles anyway? That animal seems to be pretty round if you ask me...) Anyway, MB-Ruler is quite a useful little application, especially for anyone who has had to work with banners and graphics for the Web. You can measure angles in radians or degrees, and distances in inches, centimeters, twips, points or pixels. And if those weren't enough options, you can even set your own scale. Everything about MB-Ruler can be customized, including its size and color. Talk about an application that ""measures up!""

Re-route E-mail Forwarding Service
http://www.re-route.com/
Soon, it will be time for us to fill out the change of address cards as we relocate to a different area of the city. You probably knew that your snail mail could be forwarded, but what about your e-mail? Back in the days of college e-mail accounts, every time I changed ISPs I had to send a mass e-mail to my contacts and hope they saved my new address, otherwise I could miss out on getting their correspondence. The great thing about Re-Route's service is that I don't have to worry about lost e-mails after changing ISPs. Sign up for the service, and they will take any e-mail sent to your old account and forward it to your new e-mail address. After that, Re-Route e-mails the sender to notify them of your new address. If you are with AOL, MSN, or any of their featured partners, then the first month is free. If not, then Re-Route charges a very nominal fee of ten bucks for the one month and twenty-five bucks for 3 months. Have someone else handle all my changing e-mail address need!

GnomeTIP
Just because it is summer and bright out doesn't mean that you should stop using your flash on your digital camera. Bright sunlight creates harsh shadows that may cause you to lose detail. Don't you hate those pictures where you can only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow? Well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to throw a little light into those shadows. Some cameras allow you to adjust how much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. If you can adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first. Remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add depth to your photo. Keep increasing your flash output until you get your desired results. Also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and turning off the LCD display.

* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill

Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.

The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate.

CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.

Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630:

 http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml

We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support.

* European Union bans spam

GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE

May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship.

""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
privacy of Europeans.""

While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.

""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising.""

""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""

More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
Parliament's Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,
and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
<http://www.euro.cauce.org/en/amendments1a.html>. More information on

Techs fall again with telecoms, Dow drops below 8K
The day after WorldCom Group filed for bankruptcy protection, telecom shares suffered and helped drag down the tech sector.
BellSouth stock tumbled 18.07 percent after it missed Wall Street's earnings target and offered a worse-than-expected outlook.  With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 36.5 points, or 2.77 percent, to 1,282.55.
With a report raising questions about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s role in the Enron fiasco, broader markets lost ground as well. After a see-saw session, the Dow Jones industrials ended down 234.7 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,784.5. The S&P 500 slid 27.90 points, or 3.29 percent, to 819.85.
BellSouth posts lower second-quarter profits
BellSouth Corp., the No. 3 U.S. local telephone company, on Monday posted lower second-quarter profits due to slack demand and turbulent economic conditions in North America and Latin America.

BellSouth, the dominant local telephone company in nine Southeastern states from Kentucky to Florida, said net income fell to 16 cents a share from 47 cents a year earlier.
BELLSOUTH CORP 22.61 -18.11%
WorldCom, BellSouth news adds to telecom gloom
WorldCom Inc.'s bankruptcy filing is only the latest in a long line of sad news for a slumping telecom industry grappling with soft demand, falling earnings and worries about accounting.

And things are not likely to change any time soon, as signaled by BellSouth Corp.'s disappointing second-quarter earnings and downward revision to its full-year outlook, analysts and investors said on Monday.

HP seeks Texas justice; Gateway dinged
In separate court cases, a Florida jury dinged Gateway for sending phone calls to the wrong business, and a federal court in Houston issued an injunction barring Emachines from selling products that infringe on Hewlett-Packard patents.
A jury in Florida ruled last week that Gateway must pay $3.6 million for a typo in which it sent customers with a PC problem to an 800 number owned by Pensacola, Fla.-based Mo' Money Associates instead of the company's own complaint line, which had a similar number but with an 888 prefix.

Banc of America Securities stays with ""buy"" rating on Novellus Systems in note 7/22/02
Analyst Mark FitzGerald expects the chip equipment maker to meet his revenue and earnings estimates of $225 million and 10 cents per share when it reports second-quarter results after the market close. He anticipates earnings guidance for the current quarter of 15-20 cents per share. The stock could move a bit higher, but FitzGerald believes better data from end markets is needed for a sustained rally. He also expects the firm to announce it will pay back $880 million in debt.

Tyco CFO's tenure seen ending as confidence wanes
Tyco International Ltd.'s earnings release on Tuesday may very well be the last for Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz, whose tenure has been marred by his close association with the conglomerate's disgraced former chairman.
Named CFO in 1995, Swartz has been the chief defender of Tyco's accounting, which has drawn fire for being opaque and misleading. But perhaps more important, Swartz was a key adviser and architect in Dennis Kozlowski's decade-long acquisition binge to build Tyco into one of the world's largest manufacturing conglomerates.

*Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software

Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
of the software does not violate copyright law.

Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.

In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.

Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
opportunities for artists.

On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).

Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

*Electronic Frontier Foundation Holds Second Annual Share-In
John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music Fest

San Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.

Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.

In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!

Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.

Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
technologies.

The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
artists to share with one another and their fans

Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.

When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm

Where: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the
Japanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive

Techs slump with Intel
With investors selling Intel shares before its post-market close earnings announcement, technology stocks dropped Tuesday.
Despite generally upbeat remarks on the economy by Fed Chair Alan Greenspan and news of a profitable quarter from Nextel Communications, CNET's Tech index slipped 12.4 points, or 1.25 percent, to 992.91. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 7.36 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,375.26.
Worse-than-expected earnings from construction machinery maker Caterpillar helped depress broader markets. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166.0 points, or 1.92 percent, to 8,473.1--for its seventh consecutive losing session. The S&P 500 shed 16.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 900.94--another multi-year low.
Microsoft reveals media XP details
Microsoft on Tuesday gave an official name to an upcoming version of Windows XP that aims to make the PC a permanent part of the home entertainment center.
Originally code-named Freestyle, this entertainment version of Windows--which will go by the name Windows XP Media Center Edition--will appear on new PCs and PC hybrids in time for the holidays, the company revealed on Tuesday. With Windows Media Center, consumers will be able to use a TV remote control to catalog songs, videos and pictures, as well as check TV listings.
MICROSOFT CORP 51.25 -1.06%
Intel layoffs possible
Chipmaker Intel may be on the verge of announcing massive layoffs or other cuts amid a slow market for personal computers, according to reports.
Intel CEO Craig Barrett is scheduled to speak to employees after stock markets close Tuesday, according to The Wall Street Journal. At about the same time, the chipmaker will discuss its second-quarter results on a conference call with analysts.
INTEL CORP 18.36 -3.97%
Nextel Turns Profitable, Revenues Jump
Nextel Communications Inc., the nation's No. 5 wireless telephone company, on Tuesday said it turned profitable in its second quarter, driven by strong customer demand that translated to a 25 percent revenue increase.
Nextel also said it expected 2002 operating cash flow of at least $3 billion compared with an earlier forecast calling for $2.5 billion.

Banc of America Securities begins coverage of Power Integrations with a ""market performer"" rating in tech notes 7/16/02
Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely to rise much in the short term.

French TV exec says Vivendi tapped him for CFO
A French television executive said on Tuesday he had been approached about taking over as finance chief at beleaguered media giant Vivendi Universal -- and acknowledged the job would be a ""challenge.""

Jacques Espinasse, chief operating officer at French satellite TV consortium TPS, has been cited by the French press as a candidate for the financial hot seat at Vivendi, which is grappling with cash and debt problems in the wake of the sacking earlier this month of chairman Jean-Marie Messier.

Dear Investor,

Thank you again for requesting our free special 
report, ""The One Stock that Keeps Wall Street 
BUZZING.""

We began The Motley Fool in 1993 with the idea that 
investors like you deserved better. 

Better than Wall Street's all-too-often biased 
research...  Better than analysts who speak in ""secret 
codes"" allowing them to hedge or spin any 
recommendation...  and better than what passes for ""full 
financial disclosure"" in big business today.

Given a level playing field, we believe that regular 
folks -- like us, and you -- can do quite well in the 
stock market. Why put trust in conflicted information 
from others when you could count on your own 
abilities, and potentially blow the pros away? 

More than two million people visit our Fool.com web 
site each month.  We spend a great deal of time at 
Fool.com instructing people HOW to invest, but not so 
much about WHERE to invest. 

And that's why we created the Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor.

You are cordially invited to join us as a Charter 
Subscriber to Motley Fool Stock Advisor as we focus on 
the great companies of the U.S. stock market.

you our best stock recommendations and other financial 
insights to help you achieve your financial dreams.

Stock Advisor newsletter delivered to your home each 
month -- a personal communication from us, David &  m 
Gardner.  We'll tell you exactly why we believe a 
stock is poised for significant growth -- and give you 
all the facts to back that analysis up.  You'll get 
the good, the bad and the ugly on every recommendation 
we make -- so you can make each investing decision 
with great confidence.

Of course, there's more to our Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor than our monthly newsletter.

You'll also receive our monthly, between-issue, e-mail 
Fool Flash to help you take full advantage of breaking 
opportunities.  And you can log on anytime at the 
Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber-only Web site, 
featuring current & back newsletter issues...full 
updates on our selected stocks...Q & A...and more.

entirely RISK-FREE.

What's Hot in the World of DivX(tm) Video This Week:
Battle of the Planets in DivX, Warcraft III, and the Latest Skins
Now Sent to Over 1.6 Million DivX Fans Worldwide!


  Welcome to this week's edition of DivX News, your weekly fix of
  information about what's hot and what's cool in the world of
  DivX video.

  (You are being sent this email because you subscribed to this
  newsletter at DivX.com. If you'd like to unsubscribe, follow

  In This Week's Issue
  --------------------

  1. Classic Battle of the Planets in DivX Video
  2. Warcraft III with DivX Video Sells like Hotcakes
  3. Skins, Skins and More Skins

  
  Battle of the Planets in DivX Video!
  ------------------------------------
  
  One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened
  up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may
  not otherwise be widely seen.
  independent short films to cult
  movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers
  and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great
  way to get their content in front of new audiences.
  
  A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking
  animated series ""Battle of the Planets"" from Sandy Frank
  Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late
  1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was
  one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The
  series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic
  adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from
  invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and
  anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the
  subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout
  the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of
  the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode
  ""Mammoth Shark Menace"" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase,
  and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets
  episodes to come.

* Watch ""Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace"" in the
  DivX Showcase:
Warcraft III Sets Sales Records
  -------------------------------

  A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game
  ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" from Blizzard Entertainment would
  feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July,
  Blizzard released ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" with
  record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to
  retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to
  more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite
  games in the near future....

* Watch the ""Warcraft III"" Trailer in High-quality DivX Video:
* Read more about the successful launch:
The Latest DivX Player Skins
  ----------------------------

  Let's face it--if you don't have the latest Player skins, you're
  just not cool.
  
* DisPlayer: A sleek, stylish full-screen skin that will give you
  the home theatre experience on your PC. Submitted by ""DIVX
  Budman.""
* Coldfusion: A futuristic skin design dripping in coolness.
  Submitted by ""gryphix.""
* DVDesque: As the title suggests, this skin has a groovy DVD-player
  design to complement the DivX experience. Submitted by ""NellyNel.""
For all the new skins, check out the DivX Skins section:

This year's
SIC
gets the blame for the 
lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting 
software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product 
demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip 
to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar 
faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged 
e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information 
exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and 
sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.
One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, 
is Nick Bradbury's release of
pStyle 3.0
. 
Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia 
family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing 
roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning 
hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that 
previously defined   pStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is 
just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of 
the next two issues.
Also in the coming soon category - a Gnome me on Cold Fusion, written by 
one of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an 
expert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the
Training
  the Source
book on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for 
ColdFusionMX. The Gnome me means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for 
both static pages, in the form of
Dreamweaver tips
, and tips on dynamic 
site development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.

GnomeMAIL
Email 911
http://www.email911.com
E-mail remains the killer app of the Internet, despite all the incredible 
artistic efforts by many Web designers. As we all know, e-mail is also a 
source of great frustration and misuse - turning otherwise likeable folks 
into enemies of your inbox defense system. Email 911 aims to educate the 
ignorant, while aiding those of us with a reasonable understanding of 
effective e-mail communication in ways to make e-mail even more useful. 
The newsletters and discussions affiliated with this site should be 
required reading for all corporate users, although home users would most 
certainly benefit as well. For an exceptional look at eliminating junk 
from your inbox, check out the e-book ""What Can I Do About Spam?""
GnomeTOOLS
ApacheConf v2.0 [1.1MB] W9X/NT/W2K/XP $19.95
http://www.zecos.com/apacheconf/index.html
Configure your Apache httpd.conf file in a visual environment instead 
of a text editor. This tool provides a visual representation of all 
configurable options available to Apache admins, offering great 
learning capabilities for newer webmasters, as well as saving time for 
experienced administrators who tire of scrolling through screen after 
screen of configurations. A source view makes manual editing of the 
file easier, by bolding and coloring various configuration directives, 
similar to the way HTML editors mark code. Avoid typos with built-in 
error checking, which provides warnings when invalid directives are 
used.

Making A Commercial Case for Adopting Web Standards
http://www.maccaws.com/
Supporting standards and writing good code are often things that the number 
crunchers in a business don't feel are as important, when compared against 
getting the product to as many people as possible in the shortest amount of 
time possible in an effort to generate revenue. Communicating the 
importance of standards and good code can be an uphill battle; after all, 
you're just a programmer, right? MACCAWS aims to make your job easier, via 
an open discussion on the establishment of standards that will make sense 
to the folks who control the bottom line. Their mission is to educate 
business leaders by providing you the end user with tools that will help 
make a case for applying standards to your Web efforts. If you've got a 
voice you'd like to add to their cause, visit them on the Web and help 
  influence the course of Web standards development.

Dear Readers,
One of the hot trends in notebooks is squeezing desktop processors,
not mobile CPUs, into laptops. Actually, the trend has been around
for a while, but the bigger vendors used to pooh-pooh these
efforts. (Intel was never too crazy about the idea, either.) Now,
it's a bona fide movement, and the latest 9.6-pound desktop-
replacement system from  shiba takes this trend to new heights.
But questions abound: Are the extra pounds worth it? Do these 
things really get so hot that you can press pants with them? 
Executive Editor John Morris

0. INTRO

Hello SourceForge.net Users,

This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.

 day we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:

http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html

How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.

 day our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.

If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.

Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.

Pat-

Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net

EMAIL LIST REMOVAL:

When the SF.NET team sends out a site-wide email, we sometimes see
replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)"".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume"".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

* EFF Submits Letter to FCC Chairman Regarding BPDG Proposal

The Honorable Michael K. Powell Chairman Federal Communications
Commission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554


BY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL

Dear Chairman Powell:

I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television
Broadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings'
and Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which
urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the
final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported
non-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties
interests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical
role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the
Internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction
on strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that
Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;
and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests
against DMCA-related prosecution.

EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion
Group. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and
participated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF
also maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of
information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The
site can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted
thousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of
the BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy
groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose
products were threatened by the proceedings.

When you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke
briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined
by the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG
proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free
expression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it
will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,
compromising DTV adoption itself.

As you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured
those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often
in spite of the misgivings of rights-holders.
  the piano roll to
the PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever
products they believe the public will pay for; what's more,
innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest
regulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious
few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products
that interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to
the PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to
shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member
companies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,
whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until
he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to
the Hollywood studios for review.

Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the ""Open
Source"" or ""Free Software"" movement, in which technologies are
distributed in a form that encourages end-user modification.
 
server-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating
systems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla
browser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer
benefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans
Free Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer
and the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these
applications are built to be modified by end-users, something that
is banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component
of the BPDG's ""Robustness Requirements"" will create and entire class
of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First
Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive
speech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source
licenses.

The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright
line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability
when deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG
was a ""standard"" that contained no objective criteria for legal
technology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be
approved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only
technologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only
legal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C
consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's
allies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort
of regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies
will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by
allying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain
technologies and outlaw others.

The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently
producing products that increase the value and desirability of new
technologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market
for DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV
technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to
market if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about
unauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of
unauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down
to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability
of the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television
programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of
broadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR.

Ironically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate
would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only
slow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while
reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would
create. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,
they will not flock to DTV.

The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there
is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool
for protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be
effective in that role. The existing practice of Internet
infringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from
devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would
not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.
Higher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to
determined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal
from DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single
generation's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters
the Internet.

Meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that
infringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that
movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value
of DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or
analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to
Congress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The
public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry
is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of
entertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate
extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion
technology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few
studio executives.

EFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The
BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a
looking-glass ""public process"" where only those participants the
organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,
where the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit
the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology
companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly
for their products, where the press was banned.

The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public
opinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,
EFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the
BPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,
Thomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including
EFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free
Software Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the
Center for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and
Communications Industry Association.

Thank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can
be of any further assistance to you.

Sincerely yours,

Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation

* Update on Intel Corp. v. Hamidi

Intel Corp. v. Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme
Court. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,
2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six
occasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to
between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi
stop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi
from e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,
based on the common-law tort of ""trespass to chattels."" (""Chattel""
is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to
property in land.)

EFF's amicus brief argues three main points.

(1) Intel did not qualify for relief under ""trespass to chattels""
because Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by
Hamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of
Hamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the
e-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers.

(2) By focusing on unwanted ""contact"" with the chattel and ignoring
the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned ""trespass to
chattels"" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity
like search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a
""no trespassing"" sign, any ""contact"" by a search engine could be
considered a trespass even if it caused no harm.

(3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not
infringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits
private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,
out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress
criticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's
claims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech.

* DeCSS Author Johansen's Trial Rescheduled

The trial of Norwegian teen Jon Johansen, who created the
controversial DeCSS software, has been pushed back again. It is now
scheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the
fall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content
scrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort
to build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of
2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen
with a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which
outlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal
data that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first
time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his
own property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if
convicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by
the Motion Picture Association.

The trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of 
2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified 
judges to hear Johansen's case.  Now the case is scheduled to be 
heard by a three-judge panel. Help Jon in his battle against 
Hollywood movie studios, donate to his legal defense fund at:

* Bunnie Presents Paper on XBox Reverse Engineering

Paper Explains Flaw in Videogame Security System

Researcher Escapes Chilling Effect of Digital Copyright Law

Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Advisory

For Immediate Release: Thursday, August 9, 2002

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is pleased
to announce that former MIT doctoral student Andrew ""Bunnie"" Huang
will present a paper explaining a security flaw in the Microsoft
Xbox (TM) videogame system.

Huang will present his paper, ""Keeping Secrets in Hardware: the
Microsoft X-BOX Case Study,"" at 5:25 p.m. PDT on August 13, 2002, at
the 2002 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems
(CHES 2002) in Redwood City, California (Aug. 13-15, 2002).

The Xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only
videogames authorized by Microsoft. Huang's paper ""shows how a
person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,""
said MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. ""More
importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a
general design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems
such as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's
Contents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players.""

Huang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his
preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.
With the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked
with Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal
issues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research
findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

Microsoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the
paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to
withhold the paper.

""Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control
publication,"" said Abelson. ""Their response shows that they value
academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of
unfettered research and publication in advancing technology.""

Other companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten
researchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year
warned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team
exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last
month, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft
over exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating
system. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to
stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve
computer security.

Huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,
""The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to
submit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to
clear potential legal restraints.""

""Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about
getting sued,"" said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.

* Baen Books expands fair-use-friendly e-book program

Baen Books will bind a CD-ROM into the October 2002 hardcover
edition of *War of Honor,* the latest volume in David Weber's epic
Honor Harrington space-opera. The CD will contain at least 22
complete novels, all in open formats like html and RTF, with the
fair-use-friendly admonishment ""This disk and its contents may be
copied and shared but NOT sold."" Included on the disk are the entire
Honor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the
Baen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*.

Baen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic
publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a
multitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their
material in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to
legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a
specific device, can't play on every operating system, and
occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers
employed by the blind.

Dmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for
demonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention
employed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest
Skylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing
copy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his
employer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the
Russian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists
to steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is
repealed.

Here is Baen's statement on the CD release:

You are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly
extraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two
UNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington
Novels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of
Honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.
(More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work
around. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to
try to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm
Pilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices.

Filled with useful examples and the depth, clarity, and 
attention to detail that made the first edition so popular 
with web developers, the just-released ""JavaServer Pages,  
2nd Edition"" (Bergsten, $44.95) is completely revised 
and updated to cover the substantial changes in the 
1.2 version of the JSP specifications, and includes 
coverage of the new JSTL Tag libraries--an eagerly 
anticipated standard  set of JSP elements for the tasks  
needed in most JSP  applications, as well as thorough 
coverage of Custom Tag Libraries.  

What people said about the first edition:

""an excellent printed resource on JSPs...I have 
been extremely impressed by its depth, clarity,
 and attention to detail. "" 
--Reuven M. Lerner, Linux Journal

""This is a great book: it was written by a key 
contributor not only to the JSP specification, 
but also to the JSP and  Servlet reference 
implementations. Filled with useful examples,
 it stands as an important text in the adoption of 
JSP in the market."" 
--Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart, lead JSP Specification Engineer.

AOL KEYWORD: FRAUD PROBE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Another three bite the dust. Three former executives from real
estate dot-com Homestore have agreed to plead guilty to criminal 
charges and repay $4.6 million in stock gains. What's more
interesting is that they'll cooperate with an investigation into 
AOL's role in the dubious dealing. This is the most real estate
drama you'll get this week without renting ""Glengarry Glen
Ross.""

Homestore's former COO was charged with wire fraud and
conspiracy to commit securities fraud (up to 10 years in jail),
the former CFO with just the conspiracy charge (up to five
years), and an ex-VP with insider trading (less time, but
unknown). The big accusation here is ""round tripping,"" in which
Homestore would buy goods from a company as long as the company
then spent most of the money on AOL ads. Then AOL would
supposedly spend the same amount of money at Homestore, ""thus
allowing Homestore effectively to 'buy' revenue using its own
cash,"" explained the Wall Street Journal.

Homestore has become a cause celebre for Attorney General John
Ashcroft, who held a press conference to emphasize that the Bush 
administration really means it about this corporate clean-up
thing. Neither Ashcroft, the Justice Department, nor the SEC
named names, referring only to Homestore's relationship with ""a
major media company."" Nice try for anonymity, but AOL Time
Warner was the only major media company Homestore dealt with,
observed the New York Times. Now the heat's on AOL while
investigators try and figure out how much of AOL's revenue was
inflated like a Thanksgiving Day Parade float.
 
The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at
former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and
expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted
Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do
its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked
legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already
been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another
company; his boss got booted last month for possible
book-cooking. 

So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that 
make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but 
that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this
comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had
one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice
chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey
team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority
owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he
lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone
as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no
Jack Welsh/GE $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do. -

VIVENDI MEETS THE NEW BOSS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
What does Vivendi want to be when it grows up? The media can't
figure it out. Can CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou? His fuzziness at
yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he
can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20
clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For
Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the
comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he
resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the vilified
Jean-Marie Messier.

Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's
latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets
devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24 
paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in
an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.  
The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still 
had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's
influential column. Lex called the exec's update ""more like a
rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation.""

There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The
company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth
of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters
examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu, 
an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a
maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing
properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake 
in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom, via
its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment
properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's
plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote.
  confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in
the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according
to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd
consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll
increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone
conference. 

The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was
his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier.
""He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the Guardian
quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""This all went to his 
head."" 

With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's
viability again in doubt? Outlets today report that Enron's
logo, the oversize capital ""E"" that stood outside its
headquarters, sold at auction for $44,000. How many euros might
a V bring? - Deborah Asbrand

The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another company; his boss got booted last month for possible book-cooking.
So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he
lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no Jack Welsh/GE $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do. - Jen Muehlbauer

Vivendi Meets the New Boss
What does Vivendi want to be when it grows up? The media can't figure it out. Can CEO Jean-René Fourtou? His fuzziness at yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the
vilified Jean-Marie Messier.
Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24 paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.  The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's influential column. Lex called the exec's update ""more
like a rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation.""
There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu, an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom,
via its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote.   confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone
conference.
The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier. ""He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the Guardian quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""This all went to his head.""
With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's viability again in doubt? Outlets today report that Enron's logo, the oversize capital ""E"" that stood outside its headquarters, sold at auction for $44,000. How many euros might a V bring? - Deborah Asbrand

***Updating Data Safely with A DataSet, by Alex Homer

OK, so we can�t store all three values for a row (the current, original
and the underlying values) in the tables of our DataSet. Is this actually
important? What do we actually need to perform the process, and what do
users actually expect to see? Can we make do with just two values instead
of three, (and don�t you hate books that keep asking questions)?

Author Interviews

***With Fran�ois Liger, Craig McQueen and Paul Wilton, authors of Visual
Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook.

[AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET
developer, and so who do you think needs this book?

[CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming
tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is
difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in
finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that
is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers.

[PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and
regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are
the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a
great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the
regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight
in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work
with when writing the book.

[AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET.

***With  bin Titus, author of Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook

In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET.
There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out
on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview  bin
Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on
the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related
topics.

What is free threading? 

Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an
application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of
threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those
threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the
developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should
end, and what it should do while executing.

***C# day Free Code Download

Due to customer feedback, C# day have decided to try out something new
this week - we are making this week's code  download \ support material
available to all non-subscribers (providing they are a member of the Wrox
Developer Community, which is free to join).

This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM 
http://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid026

The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate
source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET
facility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a
complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel
object, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code.  gether
these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to
develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in
code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which
attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an
existing C# or VB.NET project.


***Get on the Fast Track to Success

If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core
.NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for
you.

The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by
providing concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts
and understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By
targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to
concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics.

Updating Data Safely with a DataSet,
an article by
Alex Homer
""OK, so we can�t store all three values for a row (the current, original and the underlying values) in the 
tables of our DataSet. Is this actually important? What do we actually need to perform the process, and 
what do users actually expect to see? Can we make do with just two values instead of three, (and don�t 
you hate books that keep asking questions)?""

WROX ANNOUNCEMENTS
AUTHOR INTERVIEWS
- With
Fran�ois Liger, Craig McQueen
and
Paul Wilston,
authors of
Visual Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook
Q. What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET developer, and so who do you think needs this book?
[CM]
The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming tasks. String manipulation is a 
large part of programming and it is difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in finding existing code 
to do the job rather than rewriting something that is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers.
[PW]
I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and regular expressions are 
not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a 
great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the regular expression reference at the back of the book 
is worth its weight in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work with when writing the book.
[AP]
In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET

- with
bin Titus,
author of
Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook
In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET. There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out on what 
seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview  bin Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on the book, as 
well getting his opinions on various programming-related topics.
Q. What is free threading?
Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of 
threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the developer 
to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should end, and what it should do while executing.

Get on the Fast Track to Success
If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core .NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for you. 
The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by providing concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts and 
understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to 
concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics.

C# day Free Code Download
Due to customer feedback, C# day have decided to try out something new this week - we are making this week's code  download \ support material available to all non-subscribers 
(providing they are a member of the Wrox Developer Community, which is free to join).
This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM
http://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid027
The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET facility and has 
attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel object, which allows programmatic access to 
hand-written code.  gether these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs 
in code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an existing C# or VB.NET project.
There are four new lists in the .NET category
on p2p:
beginning_c_sharp_databases
Connecting your C# code to data sources
aspx_web_matrix
Discuss Web Matrix, a free application development tool for ASP.NET
weo_object_builder
Generate code in C# or VB.NET for SQL Server
regular_expressions
Principles and use of Regular Expressions

MARKET CAN'T FIND ITS BOTTOM WITH BOTH HANDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when Nasdaq 2500 seemed impossibly low? Welcome back to 
cruel reality. These days, with few analysts willing to call a
market bottom, financial reporters outdo each other with dire
assessments of how bad things are and how much worse they can
get. Maybe Morrissey should do a concert on Wall Street; the
self-pity can't get much worse.

The markets' closing numbers were the same in every city, but
you wouldn't know it from the headlines. It was the Dow's worst
monthly performance in four years, said MSNBC. ""3rd quarter
worst for stocks since '87,"" read the Denver Post, repeating a
popular figure reached by tallying the Dow and S&P's percentage
losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for
the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937.
Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase
""self-fulfilling prophecy"" does spring to mind. 

So does the phrase ""gloom and doom."" ""Every day for the last
three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the
United States,"" said the San Jose Mercury News. ""Countless
investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up
again,"" wrote USA  day. In a more plausible statement,
TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines ""demonstrated
once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint 
a bottom"" and ""disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time
to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history 
has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond."" 

OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better?
Good, because there's more.

The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to
understand, made the public service announcement ""Beware!
October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market."" And you
shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John
Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned,
""This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they
couldn't get any worse."" Detroit Free Press columnist Susan
 mpor agreed that ""the next round of statements could indeed
look pretty nasty."" 

We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad.
It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take 
a while. The ""bottom"" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes,
but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just
like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't
the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer

WINNICK: HANDS-OFF OR RED-HANDED?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Former Global Crossing chairman Gary Winnick will appear before
a Congressional committee today. It won't be pretty. CNN
predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected
Winnick to testify.

Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the
House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that
Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A
committee spokesman said, ""If he tries to portray himself as an
out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him
that he is under oath.""

The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO
Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful
language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial
Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from
the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to
unload the company -- ""without looking like we are shaking our
bootie all over the world,"" quoted the two Timeses -- and
resigned shortly thereafter.

One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's 
time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among
the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals,
was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York
Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never
completed a deal with the fallen energy giant.

The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing 
details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence,
the gun might not be smoking yet. ""Prosecutors would still need
to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used
them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the
company's stock price artificially,"" the Journal reporters
wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after
Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in
May 2001.

Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not
among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney
general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is
Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away
clean? - Keith Dawson

all you Dream Theater fans out there, please accept my humblest of apologies. 
I mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio section, causing 
quite a stir among a number of subscribers. In fact, they just released a double 
album this year and have been touring in support of that release. 
For today's false alarm, please make note of the tragedy that is the N'SYNC 
breakup (oh wait, that's just wishful thinking).
I know I've already carried on about my Kyocera 6035 phone, but this thing is 
awesome.  I've got all my contacts in one device. Web browsing is good - I'm 
sure it would be better on a color screen, like the
Treo 270
, but for what I'll need, 
this works well. I'm currently looking for an ssh client I can install, so that 
remote server logins will be possible. My one complaint is the base station's 
use of a serial connector instead of USB, but I suppose they were cutting costs.
I'm also scoping out the
Palm Markup Language
(PML) standard for marking up Palm Docs, 
in an effort to make the Gnome mes a little flashier. I've installed several of 
the files on my phone and while they are easy to read, have all the content 
organized, and function as useful tips for the various subjects, I'd like to add 
some minor tweaks to future tomes, so that they look even better for me and 
anyone else who reads them on their Palm.

meRaider v2.0 [1673k] W98/W2K/Pocket PC/Palm $25
http://www.tomeraider.com/
Of the formats Lockergnome uses for our Gnome mes,  meRaider is by far my 
favorite. Designed with a feel similar to CHM, the TR format is quite easy 
to read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, 
allowing you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) 
with much greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. 
The Windows version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in 
mind. Creating ebooks for  meRaider is a simple matter of combining a 
modified set of HTML tags with the
designation for page breaks. The 
only trick for Yankees like me is remembering that center is tagged centre 
in the software.

Triumph the dog is low-tech, he's not cute like the pets.com sock puppet, 
but he manages to maintain a twisted appeal to fans of lowbrow comedy. In 
this segment, Triumph makes a mockery of geeks standing in line for 
Episode II. Whether you've been one of those geeks yourself, or you've 
never understood why anyone would dress up and wait in line for a movie, 
you'll still find this film amusing. 10 minutes was more than necessary 
to get the point across, yet Triumph delivers enough one-liners 
throughout to keep you watching all the way to the end.

Heleen van den Hombergh

http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/378/heleen_van_den_hombergh.html
Classic jazz vocal styling, juxtaposing arrangements of contemporary 
pieces with arrangements of jazz standards. Combined with some 
beautiful piano arrangements, Heleen's voice is a thing of beauty. A 
Netherlands native,  who originally dreamed of saving the rainforests 
(at least according to her biography), her interpretation of American 
jazz standards and show tunes is more remarkable than most native 
English speaking vocalists. No world tour is currently scheduled, so 
you'll probably have to journey to Europe to see her in person, but 
for those of you living elsewhere in the world, the Internet makes a 
fabulous venue for experiencing Heleen  van den Hombergh's talent.

The Man Who Wasn't There
(R) 2001
Drama - 116min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)
Special DVD Features worth a look-Thornton and Coen Brothers Commentary
Much more film noir, than a movie trying to imitate film noir, The Man
Who Wasn't There captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre. Ed
Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade,
Crane represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but
truly knows nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by
the retelling. He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations.
Left to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, Crane
develops an indifference to it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers
into town, Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish
the punishers.  As indifferent as Crane appears, he is no match for the
amorality of fate. As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however,
so is it artistic in its execution. That is what makes our lives so
entertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. The
Man Who Wasn't There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual's year
to turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of cuter, more
recent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier
noir works like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. Frances McDormand
does an outstanding job making as Crane's selfish wife and James
Gandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris' boss. The real outstanding
performances, however, rest with the supporting cast.  ny Shalhoub, as
pompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and  Jon Polito as the snake oil
salesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their
characters. The black and white cinematography by Roger Deakins also
impresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of Crane's life and
the monochromatic nature of fate.

I did a lot this weekend, but I didn't really get much done, 
ya know? My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of 
the basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only 
made it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted 
the floor where that collection of stuff was previously 
stored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more 
stuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick 
ferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next 
room over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the 
migration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret 
cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure 
it's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now.
I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws 
with stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that 
the ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped 
out heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely 
getting started. The front steps are also in need of rust-
proof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I 
moved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds 
of the way through the first row, I found that the extra 
1/2"" on the screws I purchased was too much and I began 
running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. 
Figures. Live and learn.
Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. 
Back down to the basement I went to geek out instead. 
Roughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized 
it was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually 
stuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I 
really could and still work on a couple of projects, but it 
didn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot 
outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added 
heat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower 
and with only the notebook in the living room for the 
balance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient 
email, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished 
otherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away.
Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD 
tomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could 
watch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just 
that. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back 
from DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac 
to see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In 
theory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way 
through. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script 
technique in the
AppleCore newsletter
.  o bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player.
See You in

Slow File Save Dialog Boxes
Pointed out by Ian Hargreaves
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126
I've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a 
hotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will 
work best. I often map drive letters to specific network 
shares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll 
notice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes 
in Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 
attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you 
the list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped 
and how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take 
eons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My 
Network Places functionality instead of mapping drive 
letters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters 
mapped for many things, being that I work at a command 
prompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. 
Alternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to 
contact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you 
choose.

Customized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors
http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/
We've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue 
screens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide 
no real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer 
that has had to deal with error conditions produced by 
Windows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle 
them within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an 
ActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error 
functions, but provides a way to pass along text and 
response options you designate. Note that this is not 
functional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors 
in an entirely different manner.
Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513
Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when 
reading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. 
The Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really 
don't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is 
performance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also 
looking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that 
Celerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have 
typically provided a decent enough experience that they can 
make for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded 
consumer. The compatibility issues with this particular 
version of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to 
watch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron 
core, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but 
the 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without 
adding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what 
hardware you're buying is what's important here.

Test Drive Compaq Servers
http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/
Compaq (Ok, HP) offers a set of servers running various 
*nix operating systems, as well as Oracle 9i, for test 
drive. Just register for an account and you can tinker 
around with Linux, FreeBSD or even Tru64 Unix running on an 
Alpha server, but without the hassle and expense of 
obtaining your own toys. I love the idea of having a pre-
configured environment that lets you kick the tires without 
causing any permanent damage.

o Cool
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102779,00.asp
This was just too interesting not to mention. Water-cooled 
systems are all-the-rage among overclockers and those 
that seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer 
systems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and 
applying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook 
computers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very 
hot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and 
I have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my 
own little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling 
system Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat 
mitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of 
a water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would 
welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open 
arms.

Techs rise, but Dow falls on day of Bush speech
Technology shares climbed Monday as Pres. Bush gave a speech outlining a plan for long-term growth.
Tech investors also heard positive comments on Intel by C.S. First Boston, and snapped up shares in the chip, storage and computer server hardware sectors. CNET's Tech index rose 15.22 points, or 1.53 percent, to 1,005.33, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 9.04 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,382.54.
Amid news of a weakening dollar and an unexpected rise in business inventories in May, broader markets sank. Recovering some from early-day losses, the Dow Jones industrials finished by giving up 45.4 points, or 0.52 percent, to 8,639.1, and the S&P 500 slid 3.47 points, or 0.38 percent, to 917.92.
Will IBM's new ""Shark"" sink or swim?
IBM announced a new top-end ""Shark"" storage system Monday that could boost the company's prospects against entrenched competitors in the depressed storage market.
Three years ago, IBM introduced its first Enterprise Storage System product, code-named Shark, in an attempt to rebuild a market it had almost totally ceded to rivals EMC and Hitachi Data Systems.

New products help absorb AMD pain
Advanced Micro Devices turned out two new chips Monday, but its most anticipated release this week will be its second quarter results.
As expected, AMD launched on Monday a new mobile Athlon XP 1800+ chip for notebooks. The company also announced Monday it has begun shipping MirrorBit, its newest flash memory product for storing data in cell phones and other devices.
ADVANCED MICRO DEV 9.25 1.65%
Microsoft tries to steal Macworld thunder
Microsoft on Monday launched the first of several pre-emptive strikes against Apple Computer's Macworld trade show by making announcements about new technologies far ahead of their delivery to market.
The strategic attack comes as tensions mount between Apple and Microsoft. During Macworld five years ago, the two companies announced a five-year technology agreement, whereby Microsoft committed to continued development of Office and Internet Explorer for the Mac.

C.S. First Boston expects an upbeat outlook from Intel in tech notes 7/15/02
Analyst Tim Mahon predicts the chip titan will report second-quarter results in-line with expectations, but offer better-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. Intel rival AMD's poor quarterly results stemmed more from company-specific issues than PC market troubles, Mahon says. And he points to other evidence of PC strength, such as Dell's positive comments about the current quarter. Mahon also expects Intel to speak confidently about its new 845G chipset, which he suggests could pressure the shares of graphics chip firms. Mahon reiterates a ""buy"" rating on Intel.

I don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all, 
metaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written 
well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll 
depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a 




recent metaphor.
I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at 
the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude, 
though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of 
enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open 
source worlds that I don't like or believe in.
Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (""Gnu's Not Unix""), 
HURD (""Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons""), WINE (""Wine Is Not an Emulator""), even 
PHP (""PHP Hypertext Processor"") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the 




Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff.
So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only 
have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition 
of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the 
course of a year talking about what's
wrong
with our system than what's 
right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be 
a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or 
those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would 
disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of 
course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect 
recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual 
inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from
outside
the US 




disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would 




be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being 
disagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of 
other countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to 
disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of 
recursion and a final layer of metaphor.
The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In 
the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the 
two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion 
published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held 
opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the 
metaphor in a perfect way.
Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure 
whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just 
been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will 




remain mercifully nameless:
We get enough
America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here
in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here)
from Belgium whining too!
Followed by:
... please don't let  ny single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation
of Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who 
would be able to replace him.
... and, in a later note on the topic ...
Censorship is to be encouraged in a
free-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the
government.
Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some.
Chris
has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial 
piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no 
exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill 
comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has 
shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans 
with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes 
the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch.
So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to 
occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff.
Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye 
out.

Win Apps in Linux?
Yesterday, I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by
CodeWeavers
- CrossOver 
Office and CrossOver Plugin. You've probably heard of both by now, as they've 
garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world. You'll 
recall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week. With the 
help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was able to accomplish that task 
this morning. True to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few 
days looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use. 
Let's take them in chronological order, starting today with CrossOver Plugin.
A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, "" ... the 
leading corporate backer of the
Wine Project
. Wine has been, for the past several years, an 
ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but 
it's also one that's been undertaken by
others
in the past year or so. Though the progress has been 
slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development 
realm.
CrossOver 
Plugin
marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its 
release, Wine had taken a ""full system"" approach. Running Windows applications 
in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of 
configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide 
approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system 
startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called 
program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on 



creating Linux functionality with
one
related set of Windows 
applications: browser plugins.
The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a 
success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player 



6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser 
plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web 
Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need 
covered.
But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package 
are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several 
Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications 
offered by the CodeWeavers developers.
Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install 
process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with 
my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped 
for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want 



these apps to work.
The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from 



the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin 



and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin 
installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the 
background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\ drive on my 
machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight 



- the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for 
feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped 
out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed 
four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the 
CrossOver program. I kept ""retry""ing and, with some persistence, managed to get 
a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally, 
the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows. 
When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary, 
located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\ drive and dropped the 
plugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins 
directories.
The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these 
browsers - ""Help"", ""About Plugins."" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin 
was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the ""Men In Black 
II"" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.
I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax 
Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the 
CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to 
the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within 



a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.
Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite 
the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as 
smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much 



faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, 
reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty 
strong given my previous troubles with Wine.
I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda. 
In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless.
Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the 
tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the 



backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, 
Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications 
seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if 



I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better 
in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I 
missed them until I started using them in Linux today.
morrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office 
package.

Kernel Configuration - Part IX
We're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to 
go. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration 
screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and 
function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear 
decision as to how to configure each section.
day, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you 
need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either 
as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module.
Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer. 



But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds 
I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the 
telescope cameras were attached to this port.
Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for 
the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or 



Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will 



work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer 
following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the 
BIOS.
morrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.

""Netics is an extensible network statistics collector. It puts the network 
interface in promiscuous mode and reads the data stream (after it strips off the 



appropriate protocol headers), then displays the results at specified intervals, 



either in a ""progress bar"" mode or as raw statistics. Currently, it supports 2 
statistics, both involving entropy: LZW compressability and Ueli Maurer's 
universal statistical test. Maurer's test is a very good and comprehensive 
measure of entropy, but requires a large amount of data. The LZW statistic 
requires much less data.""

UNITED WE FALL?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
US Airways scored a $500 million bankruptcy court bailout.
American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent
company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for 
Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September,
but it's not much consolation to airline employees,
shareholders, and customers that it's happening now.

The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of
American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay
off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight
amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make
for longer layovers. ""In the past, airlines were loath to have
longer connection times because flights were listed in travel
agents' computers by elapsed time,"" said the Journal. ""Now,
online booking tools and search engines most often list flights
by price, not time."" In this age of penny-pinching, American's
worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US
Air and United. 

Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its
parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster.
Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price
may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an
increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air
Transportation Stabilization Board. ""The ATSB expects an
applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions 
to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S.
taxpayers' interests,"" said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for
uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions, 
which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring 
$498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the
36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor
frustration. 

The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and
non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. ""The U.S.
government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and
federal loan guarantees"" while ""European authorities have acted
more wisely,"" letting Swissair and Sabena ""go to the wall,"" said 
the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should 
let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline
industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and
Canada 3000. Paging Charles Darwin to the white courtesy
phone... - Jen Muehlbauer

SLEEPING WITH THE PENGUIN
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, which opened yesterday in
San Francisco, will host two of the strangest bedfellows ever to 
lie down with a stuffed penguin: Microsoft and Sun. These are
companies that once referred to Linux as a ""bathtub of code""
(Sun) and ""a cancer"" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown
paper the San Jose Mercury News.

Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute
numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on
server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in
the entire year.

Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at 
the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the
Seattle Times this way: ""Microsoft executive Peter Houston
wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld
... until he heard about the pie cannon.""

Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft 
will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- ""a place where 
you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,""
deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: 
""Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to
grow.""

Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press
release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus
 rvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon
Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to
scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a
version of Linux, to be called ""Solinux."" How time does make
April fools of us all: Linus  rvalds is now thriving in Silicon 
Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems
demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first
general-purpose servers running Linux.

The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude
toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but
to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some
of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it.
""Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun
servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running
Linux,"" Poletti reported. And you thought Microsoft hated Linux?

Dear Readers,
=09=09=09
On the surface, it seems odd that Microsoft and AOL compete with
one another. After all, while Microsoft is a giant software
powerhouse, AOL Time Warner is totally different--a giant media
powerhouse. Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy
to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts
of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape
browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN
8.0. Will Microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up
with AOL? It just might.

First Take: MSN 8.0 Beta
Redmond has been talking up the newest version of MSN for months,
and now, the proof""s in the pudding. Testers have their hands on
the beta of MSN 8.0, and so far, this ISP looks and works better
than past versions. The great No. 8 even has antispam tools and
improved parental controls. But will MSN topple AOL?
First Take: ICQ Lite Alpha
One of our biggest beefs with ICQ has always been its bloated
feature set. Now, the company has released a new lite ICQ that
sucks up far less system memory than the full-fat version--but at
what cost? We take an early look.

Techs gain on Intel, Motorola news
Although computer chip titan Intel posted lower-than-expected earnings, its upbeat forecast helped lift technology shares Wednesday.
Also boosting the sector was Motorola, which beat expectations for operating earnings and predicted a net profit in the last two quarters of the year. CNET's Tech index rose 14.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,007.37, and the tech-laced Nasdaq composite index tacked on 21.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,397.23.
With aircraft maker Boeing beating the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate, the Dow Jones industrials increased 69.37 points, or 0.82 percent, to 8,542.48. The S&P 500 rose 5.08 points, or 0.56 percent, to 906.02.
Motorola Sees Profit Rebound
CHICAGO - Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. on Wednesday said it expects to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by aggressive cost cutting.

Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215 million related to previously announced restructuring actions.

The world's second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.
MOTOROLA, INC 15.15 4.27%
Apple meets lowered expectations
Apple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched analysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools fell short of the company's initial hopes.
The company earned $32 million, or 9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48 billion

Analysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share, according to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6 billion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents per share.
APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49%
HP, EMC storage systems to work better together
SAN FRANCISCO - Hewlett-Packard Co. and EMC Corp. said on Wednesday that they were opening up technology to each other in order to maker their storage systems work better together.

However, the deal will not include technology from Hitachi Data Systems, which makes the hardware for HP's high-end storage system, an HP spokesman said.

The deal follows close cooperation between storage heavyweight EMC and Compaq Computer Corp., which was acquired by HP in May.
HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 13.57 -4.84%

Investec Inc. stays bullish on Intel in report 7/17/02
Analysts Eric Ross and Sam Chang reiterate a ""strong buy"" rating on the computer chip giant after it reports second-quarter earnings below the consensus Wall Street estimate. Ross and Chang expect a modest seasonal increase in demand in the second half of this year, with strength in consumer laptop buying. Calling Intel the premier semiconductor firm, they suggest the stock is a bargain.

You're a good bunch, you Penguins.
day's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you a 



quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik has 
found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With 
Diabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But, 
with the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost 
irrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively 
offered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work 
for the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to 
effect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little 
callous about the 'Net ...
Accordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing part 



of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can further put 
our technical skills (be they Linux
or
Windows skills) to work for a good 



cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort, based in the 
Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services to worthwhile 
charitable organizations. First, we need a
name
that clearly describes our purpose. Next, we need 
volunteers with the time and ability to lend those
skills
to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to 
the charitable
organizations
that are near and dear to your heart. Or, 



maybe the organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain 
can use some hands-on or remote volunteer help.
I'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the
Aicardi Syndrome Foundation
. 
Though I don't currently know their technical needs, I do know that the syndrome 



is very rare - read ""research and technical dollars are minimal."" I'm sure we 
can, as a group, provide them a way to fill existing technical holes.
That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make 
others.
Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging 
program,
GeekLog
to pull together a community project area where interested parties can gather, 
coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become. I'll keep you posted 
on the details.
In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor 
Penguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their protection 
from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into the water, 
all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the community.
Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?

Quick Shortcuts
Linux is chock full of keyboard shortcuts that, when used, streamline the way 
you use your system.  day's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in shortcuts 
you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to change your 
system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips that are quick 
and very easy to learn and remember.
Got a cluttered console screen? Use
[ctrl]+l
to clear it. This does the 
same thing as the
clear
command with far fewer keystrokes.
Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the
[ctrl+d
key 



combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the 
current user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal 
window, as well.
me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can 
avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then 
I've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings 
using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's 
substantial.
Maximum efficiency. That's what Tweaks are all about.

Kernel Configuration - Part XI
We've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel configuration 



series.  day's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss configuring block 
devices in your kernel.
We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell 
issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and 
character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data. 
Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of 
data ""blocks."" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of data 
to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. Data 
intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power 
dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating data up 



to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.
Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in ""streams,"" one character 
at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle 
data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer
then
committing the data.
The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why 
they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to store or 
retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc 
surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know where 
there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under 
the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data 
together.
Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget 



about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical. 
The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm Pilot. The 
storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a physical 
storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive and account 
for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also send a signal 



back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an indication that 
character devices often communicate in both directions, as well.
So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the 
system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined 
level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the 
hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest level view of the 
process, it still shows how difficult a process physical data storage really 
is.
In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data storage. 



When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about your existing 
hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you using? What's the 



interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the drive located - on 
the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because the variables are so 
broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock configuration tip that will 
work for your personal machine every time. I can tell you this - you will have 
block devices (normally a hard drive and a floppy), and you need to answer as 
many of the above questions as you can. Find out as much about these physical 
devices as you can, and the configuration process will be relatively 
painless.
A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series continues 



to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration recommendations where 
possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make such recommendations. 
However, where the variable set is as broad as block devices, much of the 
legwork will be up to you.
morrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.
Recommend It!

also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the

You are wrong on both counts. Explanation is valid for symmetrical TCP, for
others see explanations below.

You should change that to: ... are always candidates for predictive or
preventive delay.

ACKs are delayed (per flow) in such a way that WAN-bound traffic reaching
the edge router's Ethernet interface does not exceed WAN link speed (NO
ROUTER QUEUES!). It does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation
to act -- that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive.

It slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a per-flow
basis) to accommodate WAN link speed limit and current network utilization,
rather than fill up queues at LAN speeds and empty them at WAN speeds,
eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to
slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed
threshold (90%?).

Rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. Ever heard
of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? Queueing packets
after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it?

Re: IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic

It obviously cannot dissect IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic: it sees
the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the PS on the
LAN side (VPN gateway and router are two separate devices, PS between them).
If the router does the tunneling, then the PS sees clear traffic. Typically,
in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and
the second at branch offices. The PS at the branch sees traffic inside the
tunnel whereas the unit at HQ sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows
full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends.

UDP and asymmetrical TCP (where the PS and router only see the outgoing
packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station
on the LAN) are handled differently.

For asymmetrical TCP, it will time the release of packets to the receiving
device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the
receiving host. This informs the sender's TCP/IP stack that it should slow
the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available.

For UDP, it utilizes flow-based derivative random drop. It selectively drops
only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion,
which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts.

ICMP packets exceeding policy limits are dropped.

>_Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the
queueing on
> the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that.

The real gain is manageability and control. A LAN host only knows about the
state of its own connections and is oblivious to WAN conditions until its
TCP/IP stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the WAN is
congested. A PS will predict and inform the LAN hosts' TCP/IP stacks of the
""speed limit to obey"" for every connection (based on policies and network
conditions), avoiding congestion. Control for asymmetrical TCP and UDP may
not be as ""tight"" as for symmetrical TCP, but it does work.

Queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate
control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating
with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming
congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. If
there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot
longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second. Do
you agree?

Umm, don't get me wrong here, but I think you've been fed a less-than-
accurate sales pitch.

Let's ponder this for a minute.

The device works by delaying ACKs... that is: packets with the ACK
flag set, right?

...

[letting this sink in for a while]

...

Yes, all packets in an established TCP connection have the ACK flag set.
So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits
are exceeded? Whoops.


Okay, let's assume for a second that the packets aren't actually delayed,
but that the ACK sequence numbers or TCP window size fields are re-written
(dicey). All you've accomplished is move the queueing (delaying) from
the traffic shaper to the endpoints. You still get L7-to-L7 delays. Big
deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack. Also, convincing endpoints
to do delays probably results in less-than-perfect shaping since stack
retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather
than having the shaper itself do it; the shaper knows exactly when there
is bandwidth available.

But this doesn't even begin to touch on other protocols like UDP or
ICMP. Or, for that matter, IPsec/GRE/whatever tunneled traffic.
Neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can
manipulate.


So, I'm forced to conclude that the PacketShaper either sucks in a major
way, or that your explanation/the explanation that you have been given of
it is wrong. (Sorry.)

What I think happens is that the delay is <=2msec as long as traffic
limits aren't exceeded. This is reasonable. BUT when traffic exceeds
the limits, things will begin to be queued. Now, with a well-behaved
TCP stack, this _will_ mean that it will fall back to lower transmission
rates; this is how TCP was designed, so that part isn't all wrong.

And, again, this kind of shaping isn't rocket science. That is not to
say that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumb
(always queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of the
queue), but, well, I just can't see that you can get any smarter
than queueing when limits are actually exceeded.  _Maybe_ you can do
a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on the
endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that.


Respectfully,

 : DNAT with iptables question


Howdy folks,

I've been scouring the online docs for solid info on how to accomplish DNAT 
with iptables.

Essentially, I have converted the ipmasqadm lines of the form...

ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L $WEB_OUT  http    -R $WEB_IN      http

to iptables lines of the form...

$IPTABLES -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -d $WEB_OUT --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 
$WEB_IN:80

with the accompanying lines...


$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $INTIF -o $EXTIF -m state --state 
ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF -m state --state 
ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF -p tcp -j ACCEPT

The last two lines seem functionally sorta redundant, but I threw em in in 
an effort to make this work.
So far, I am unable to show that it's working correctly... I even tried 
logging all packets...

$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $INTIF -p tcp -j LOG --log-level info
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -p tcp -j LOG --log-level info

But nothing show up in /var/log/messages or anywhere else for that matter. 
This is on a Redhat 7.3 box.
Any help, clues, flames, RT(his particular)FM, etc are appreciated.

I read the list, so please don't reply directly in addition to the list 
resposne.


Thanks,

Jer

You're missing the NEW state. The initial SYN packet will not match with
either of the first two rules. It should match the third if it's inbound,
though.

You need to insert those logging rules above any ACCEPT, REJECT or DENY
rules for them to be of any use. Are you sure the packets are hitting the
box at all? Try moving the log rules to the top of the FORWARD chain,
introduce logging rules to the PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, INPUT and OUTPUT
chains, and/or use tcpdump as well to see where the packets are travelling.

WorldCom woes dominate, BearShare 4.0 isn't what it used to be,

--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends
1
WorldCom
:
I hate to put it first, but unfortunately, all other
   tech trends are overshadowed by this scandal. Now entering its
   fourth week as front-page news, WorldCom woes continue to sap
   investor confidence. This week's big story: the top execs from

BearShare 4.0
:
This new version of the well-known peer-to-peer
   software was been completely redesigned and comes in two

   touch, but unfortunately, 4.0 fails in one key area:
   downloading music. It uses the Gnutella client, but in CNET's

Adios to options excess?
If the nation's politicians expect Silicon Valley to fall in line on the issue of expensing stock options, they're living in a fantasy world.
Flipping through my Rolodex this past week, I couldn't find one solitary technology type willing to support even the mildest proposal to change how corporations account for stock options. The more common response was a verbal ""middle finger"" shouted in the general direction of Washington.
No surprises, there. The options argument is not just about putting food on the table--make that
a lot
of food, in some cases--but about the way the computer industry views itself. Tech companies believe they belong in a different category, say, from the likes of Coca Cola, Washington Post Co. and Bank One Corp.--all which recently decided to begin expensing stock options.
Tech titans also served notice they will remember to support friends--and shun foes--in Washington next November. An empty threat? Perhaps, but consider this: in the last national election, the computer industry contributed more than $40 million (52 percent to Democrats, 46 percent to Republicans.) That was good for a seventh place
ranking
, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

says
it's easy to see why the tech industry is fighting so hard to keep options from

EDITOR'S CORNER
How to Publish Your Windows XP FTP Server to the Internet
Several of you wrote in about last week's article on installing an FTP Server. You said ""that was great, but you only told half the story"". You wanted to know two more things:
How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users
How to secure the FTP Server
There are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as ""Server Publishing"". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.
Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.
You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:
Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.
Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.
Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.
Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How   section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!
k OK
Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.
The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a ""dynamic DNS service"". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.
There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.
Until next week,

HINTS, TIPS, TRICKS & TWEAKS
Allow Dial-up Connections to Synchronize Time with Internet Time Servers
Do you use a dial-up connection but can't get your machine to synchronize its clock with an Internet time server when the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled? If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:
Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.
Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.
Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.
That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP  protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.
If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.
This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?
HOW TO'S: ALL THE NEW XP FEATURES
How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional
Last week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:
Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative  ols menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.
Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.
Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.
The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.
Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.
Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in ""clear text"", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.
Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.
Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.
Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.
Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_
account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.
Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.
WINXP SECURITY: UPDATES & PATCHES
Cumulative Patch for Windows Media Player
I think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP). At that time you could download a ""cumulative"" patch that would update the Media Player with the latest security fixes. Well, it's time to download another ""cumulative"" patch! A couple other problems were found in WMP that could cause some problems.   read more about the problem head on over to:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-WMP_Patch
You'll also find the download locations for Windows Media Player versions 6.4, 7.1 and 8.0 (XP) on that page.
Cumulative Patches for Excel and Word for Windows
If you run Microsoft Word or Excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (XP), then you need to head on over to the Microsoft site to download some security fixes. These fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! Head on over to Microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. You only need download the fix that applies to your computer:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-Word_Excel_Patch
UPGRADING & COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
A Computer May Hang During a Heavy Load with an Ericsson HIS Modem
If your computer has a Ericsson HIS modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL. The problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! Microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver.   download a fix visit Microsoft's site. After getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens!
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709UP-HIS_Modem
Knowledge Base Search Center - If it is Not Broke, Do Not Break it!
It wasn't so long ago when you could search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. It was great! But Microsoft decided to ""fix"" the Knowledge Base search page, and now it really sucks! It's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore.
Try this: go to:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US≺=kbinfo&
and on the left side of the page select Windows XP in the top drop down list box. Don't put anything in the For solutions containing...(optional) text box. Leave the Any of the words entered option selected in the Using drop down list box. For Maximum Age select 3 days. For Results Limit select 150 articles. Click Search Now. Whoa! Nothing. OK, it's reasonable to see no articles related to Windows XP in the last 3 days. Try again, this time using 7 days. Whaat? Still no articles. OK, it was a holiday week in the USA last week. Let's try 14 days. Nothing again! That seems sort of strange, doesn't it? Let's give it another try with 30 days. Still no articles! What's going on here? Keep trying for 6 months and one year. You still won't find anything. It's pretty sad, because this used to work.
WINXP CONFIGURING & TROUBLESHOOTING
A Description of the Repair Option on a Local Area Network or High-Speed Internet Connection
Here's the answer to a question I've had for a long time. What the heck does that ""Repair"" option for a network connection actually do? It's not in the help file, but it's on the Microsoft Web site. Here's what it does:
Sends an ipconfig /renew
Flushes the ARP cache with a arp -d
Reloads the NetBIOS name cache with a nbtstat -R
Updates its WINS server with an nbtstat -RR
Clear out the DNS client cache with an ipconfig /flushdns
Reregisters the client with a DDNS server with a ipconfig /registerdns
Check out the original article over at:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709CO-Repair_Option
Keyboard and Mouse Do Not Work When You Start Windows
Have you been hit with this one? You're working in Windows XP and shut down for the day. The next morning you start up your Windows XP computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! The only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. What's up with that? I still haven't figured that one out, but Microsoft has a KB article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. I doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent. But if you find that your mouse is always stuck, you might want to check out:

LESSON 2: COMPANIES GONE WRONG

Instructors: Bill Mann, TMF Otter (with Matt Richey, TMF Matt)
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690055
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690056

In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant
sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with
current events surrounding the companies you hold.

Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing
Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one
reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly
don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.

Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have
significantly more access to business management than we ever
will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable
insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of
company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond
market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft.

In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is
slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly
valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large
share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple
of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is
priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple
company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business
starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows,
whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular,
it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a
company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.

So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to
go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning
signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.

WARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH
Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of
the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best
capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the
market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted
revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April
2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the
next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E)
company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in
a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a
barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.

Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest
sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they
always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then
canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If
you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and
they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell
trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give
a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on
the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a
year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a
year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly
growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew
sequential growth.)

WARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH
By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs
were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies
growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom
lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales
were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end
of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70%
to 40%.

Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to
collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics
changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock
reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the
technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see
signs that something was wrong.

WARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS
In 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings
perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look
at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free
cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have
significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash
flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999,
Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion,
based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the
world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications
equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058

But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were
afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an
operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost
$276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in
reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than
$2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference
between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating
cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3
billion, and not in a good way.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059

The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have
saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999,
Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but
twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow
is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)

And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on
Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they
weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.

WARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS
Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's
because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's
almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best
interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the
same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.

Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally
paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the
current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds
bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I
recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of
the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders
are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same
time analysts are shouting, ""Strong buy!""
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690060
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690061

I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company
and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity
between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced
at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value
interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some
bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be
lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk.
But some are priced below face value, even way below.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062

As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at
18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance
they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent
problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with
2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not
one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports
a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than
Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they
don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.

WARNING SIGN 5: ""IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER""
For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the
largest company in the world by market capitalization. This
should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the
stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion
implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach
$34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings
higher than $12 billion in a single year.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063

As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco --
it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that
article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any
better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no
signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000,
Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8
billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of
53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then
66% higher.

Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine
a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for
future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the
midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As
investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities.
Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this
point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business
was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot
has to be right for the situation to work out.

HOMEWORK
For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after
Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you
looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company,
do the following:

- Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four
  quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,
  staying about the same, or weakening?

- Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past
  four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing
  slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?

- Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past
  three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net
  income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look
  at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around
  due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much
  more indicative of real cash flow trends.)

- If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center
  and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know
  whether your company has any debt, just type your company name
  into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)
  http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064

- Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its
  current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is
  there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario
  already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,
  this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's
  still a question you should consider.)

  help you out, we've put together the Foolish Stock Information
Form to track all of your research and information about your
stocks. You can get to by clicking here. We've also outlined how
to find all of the information above, here.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690065
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690066

So dust off the old calculator, find your company's financials,
and get to work. Quarterly financial data is best found in
company 10-Qs, and annual data is best found in company 10-Ks.
You should be able to find all of this information using
financials from either the company website or at Fool.com on the
Quotes & Data area.

The Motley Fool Online Seminar: When   Sell: The Foolish Selling Strategy
Lesson 2: Companies Gone Wrong
Instructors:
Bill Mann, TMF Otter
(with
Matt Richey, TMF Matt
)
In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with current events surrounding the companies you hold.
Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.
Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have significantly more access to business management than we ever will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft.
In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.
So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.
Warning sign 1: Slowing sales growth
Through 2000,
Nokia
(NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.
Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.)
Warning sign 2: Divergent sales and profit growth
By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%.
Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong.
Warning sign 3: Plummeting cash flows
In 1999,
Lucent
(NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers:
operating cash flow
and
free cash flow
. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.
But as Matt and I
detailed in January 2000
, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company
lost
$276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way.
The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of
$1.8 billion
.)
And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.
Warning sign 4: Watch those bonds
Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.

Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even
way
below.
As of this writing,
WorldCom
(Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid.
Tyco
(NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default.

In case you missed this week's earlier announcement, please note that there is a correction to Lesson 1.
The fifth automatic sell rule regarding stock option grants should read:
We set
3%
as our maximum for developed companies,
5%
for developing ones (use $500 million in sales as a rough boundary between the two).

CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW
The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email
Saturday, July 13, 2002
If you've ever taped a ""Seinfeld"" episode or traded music online, Uncle =
Sam may want you--to stop.
Draft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply li=
mit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transf=
erring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which =
would
limit backup copies
, has drawn objections from academics =
and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it.
Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio seg=
ment generally may ""sell or otherwise dispose of"" that analog recording or =
digital file as they wish.
The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substa=
ntial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a cons=
umer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as ""fair use.""
Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge sa=
id that record labels and film studios could
expand an ongoing copy=
right lawsuit
to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popula=
r Kazaa software.
The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Associ=
ation of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies =
in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Net=
works, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally=
 created the Kazaa software.
However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sha=
rman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in th=
e South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permis=
sion to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week th=
at Sharman could be added to the lawsuit.
Shoring up U.S. security
Computer security is becoming
increasingly critical
to Presiden=
t Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally pro=
posed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-call=
ed cybersecurity.
But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting abou=
t tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the Unite=
d States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked comm=
ittees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end =
of the week.
Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Inte=
rnet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protectio=
n functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assuran=
ce Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of St=
andards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center.
Additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own
priv=
acy czar
. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that =
the Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure=
 that new technologies ""sustain and do not erode"" privacy protections and t=
o verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guideli=
nes.
Who's running your computer?
Perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going o=
n now with their computers.
Apple Computer OS X users could let hackers
piggyback malicious cod=
e
on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service.  According to=
 the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full i=
nstructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacke=
r to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X.
The exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating me=
chanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. Acco=
rding to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature do=
wnloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a =
system. So far, there are no patches available for this problem.
Users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applica=
tions
may be vulnerable
to a recently discovered software flaw =
that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages o=
r in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company =
PivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail co=
uld carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, =
read their documents and execute programs on their computer.
Still another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets user=
s encrypt and digitally sign messages has
inadvertently weakened
security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye =
Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associ=
ates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerab=
ility in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a vic=
tim's computer.
Wi-Fi everywhere, but not everyone
One of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi=
 wireless networking technology has made its
debut
. IQinVision =
plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to p=
ut video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly ins=
tall a temporary security system.
This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and =
wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standar=
d. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital =
cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camer=
a maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi is also
invading handheld devices
. Wireless equipment mak=
er Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networki=
ng technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The car=
d, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth qua=
rter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities =
to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other c=
ompanies.
Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and o=
wners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless ca=
pabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the=
 card, wireless access becomes an option for many.
Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networ=
king. Broadband providers are
cracking down
on some customers, =
threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless sys=
tems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi ""hot spo=
ts"" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at lea=
st 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber =
can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the N=
et, for fun or for profit.
News.com special focus: China
As China's society changes and its education system matures, the country is=
 becoming a major consumer and producer of computer products. And as the gl=
obal recession leaves few fertile opportunities elsewhere, China has emerge=
d as a primary target for foreign business. A News.com three-part
special report
examines the various reasons that this may eventually b=

----------------------------------------------------------------------
iSiloX 3.25b1 addresses the following issues from iSiloX 3.2:

- Maximum width and height settings for images would not be applied

  attribute specification greater than the native width or height
  of the image.

  forced break with the <br> tag with markup at the beginning
  of the line would incorrectly be indented.
- If a parent element specifies a font-size using ems, then the

  instead of the computed font-size value.  For example, in the
  case where the parent element specified 2em, the actual computed
  value of the child would be 4em (e.g., 2 * 2em = 4em).

  tab character follows.

such is intended for testing purposes to help eliminate problems

It's a question that CNet News.com posed to the

Senate stops P2P, so should you
The U.S. Senate sets a good, albeit belated, example by shutting off peer-to-peer networking. Tech Update's

from worms and viruses--and to limit the damage a hacker can do.

I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.
First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and I'll join them. If you didn't experience
Gnomedex
last year, you missed, in the words of many industry insiders, ""The show of the year."" It was unlike any other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts, and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of
registration
, it would be hard to find a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I really do hope to see you there.
Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores. That's right.
Jake
has release a
FREE
Gnome me
on ""Converting Vinyl LPs to CD."" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well, my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead - ""Gnome"" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there, check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the Gnome mes collection.
Have a great Tuesday.

Setting the Home Page in Konqueror
Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web
and
file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only.
Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/
user
directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.
Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select ""Configure Konqueror,"" and leave the default selection of ""File Manager"" as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the ""Home URL"" text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window.
Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select ""Window"" and ""Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'"" This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.
Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.

Kernel Configuration - Part XII
Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for ""Redundant Array of Independent Discs"" or ""Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs."" No matter. They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.
Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5.
Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time.
RAID-0 ""stripes"" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.
RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0,
does
provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is ""mirrored"" across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs.
RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for
parity
information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data
can
be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes.
RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a ""spare disc"" configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.
With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option.
morrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

Windows Apps in Linux?
Scribbled by Robert Nix
""Nice coverage but I don't give a flip about Office. OpenOffice is fine
for my needs.
""What I really want is to run Quicken (at least v.2001) which is the only
app keeping me running Windows (using vmware). I've tried Quicken on Mac
OS X and it is grossly inadequate and on Linux with Wine and have so far
been unsuccessful even using tips from
http://appdb.codeweavers.com/appview.php?appId=107. I hope that GnuCash
will eventually support the online features I enjoy but that doesn't
help now.
""The reason I'm writing this is that I personally think Office products
are overrated for home users, at least now that there are several native
alternatives. For home users, finance apps are the key issue now. Do a
section on getting Quicken to run in Wine and I'll declare you a god. :)""

Important Unix Manpages
http://home.ins.de/~m.hussmann/man/
Manpages are an important part of Linux use. Armed with the proper knowledge and manpage, there are few sticky situations in Linux that can't be solved quickly. Though they can be a bit cryptic at times, manpages are really a Linux newbie's best friend.
Important Unix Manpages is a compilation of help for situations that actually have little to do with programming. They're more human interface problems than machine interface problems. This page just points out that if life was like Linux, we'd all be a lot happier.

Mac OS X Tips
is in publication 
and available for purchase at Gnome mes.com. Less than half the tips have 
appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means 
getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've 
written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, 
I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will 
find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things 
on the list has improved my personal OS X experience.
Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing 
sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the 
contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is 
truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and 
Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which 
will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be 
primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the ""Review by"" links at the bottom 
of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. 
If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the 
sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris 
and Randy.
I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months 
and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going 
to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what 
your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with 
some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting 
topics. Either way, I'm open to some
AppleScript suggestions

Sherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE
http://www.searchstandard.com/
While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning 
off some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the 
preferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local 
machine searches. This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on 
search capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of 
SearchStandard.com. This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it 
possible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site 
won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free plugins most certainly make 
finding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites, 
that much easier.

Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48
http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html
Dealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like 
intranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those 
services failing from time to time. Don't be left in the dark 
when one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed. 
The unregistered version of the product lets you verify http, 
ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service 
verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your 
local machine, verifying remote service availability and sending 
you a message when those services go down. The interface allows 
for user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail 
account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via 
a sound from your machine.
GnomeTERMINAL
For OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you 
need to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly 
useful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely 
different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions 
relating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the 
Trash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this.
  
the command line type:
sudo chown username
filename
You'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for 
username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will 
replace
filename.

As we move further into the future of Apple's Mac OS evolution, it 
remains important to understand where things evolved from. Susan 
Kare designed all the original icons for the Mac OS, way back in 
1983. In fact, that smiling Mac that appears as OS X boots is her 
creation. Check out her collection of UI artwork, from both Windows 
and Mac operating systems. Also available from Kare.com are Kare 
designed icon apparel and collections of fonts as designed by Susan.
GnomeTIP
Show Info gives you access to change the application associated with a 
particular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of 
the best features of Show Info is it's ability to store ""comments"" 
related to a file or application. This can be a great place to store 
information on recently made changes to a file, information from others 
who've looked at a file, or in the case of applications, serial numbers 
and other pertinent data you may need when dealing with tech support.

IT sees new profits in Old Glory
Can CRM be tweaked to track terrorists? As the fight against
terrorism
heats up, the government turns to the tech industry to come up with tools to secure the country against attack. It's an opportunity for patriotism--and for profits. (Nearly $38 billion is slated for homeland security.)
Software companies
are sending tens of thousands of proposals to government agencies, some of which are so new they don't have the budget to hire people to evaluate them all.

Are Spam blocklists going too far?
Many businesses are turning to spam-filtering tools to regain
control of their e-mail boxes. But legitimate e-mails are being 
deleted, too, now that
sometimes-indiscriminate blacklists
have
become a key weapon in the war against unsolicited bulk e-mail.
 Companies
subscribe to the lists, bouncing any traffic directed to their
servers that originates from those addresses. Is
overkill
the
answer to stopping spam? What is your company doing to stop
junk e-mail?

IN THIS ISSUE:

01. Secure IE
02. Disk cleanup on XP
03. Thanks but no thanks
04. Mouseless way home
05. Kartoo
06. XP time feature
07. Leaf Peeper Alert
08. Saving scraps
09. Quick access
10. Don't believe your email

And What's Coming Up Next Week in NNT Premium

01. SECURE IE.  For the past month or so, our Software Review Panel has 
been giving a grueling test to Secure IE, a piece of software that blocks 
Flash and pop-ups, prevents malicious file downloads, lets you customize 
Security Zone settings as you browse dozens of Web sites simultaneously up 
to five times faster with a tabbed interface, annotate Web page with sticky 
notes and highlighter, and save complete Web pages, even secure server 
(HTTPS) pages and archive online transaction receipts.  For what we believe 
is one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of 
software, check out what our Panel had to say at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/SoftwareReviews .  For a free trial download, 
visit http://www.secureie.com .  And if this one sweeps you off your feet, 
go to the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store and get a super 
deal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14.  With a 30-day 
guarantee, what's to lose?

02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP.  Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores 
with Disk Cleanup.  Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking 
on your hard drive.  Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup 
button to determine how many files can be safely deleted.

03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  Continuing our periodic feature of 
less-than-useful sites on the Web:  The International Center for Bathroom 
Etiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue.  It says 
it's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and 
technology regarding bathroom etiquette.  We'll resist some obvious puns.

. . . . .

West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now 
enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package.  Diane 
is our latest winner and you could be next.  Just go to the NNT Web site at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on ""Recommend NNT.""  Nothing could 
be easier.

. . . . .

04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME.    go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 
to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there.  The Enter 
key then takes you home.

05. KARTOO.  Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at 
http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual.  It's a meta search engine that 
displays results on a map in the form of a ball.  The larger the ball, the 
more relevant the result.  As you mouseover each result, site descriptions 
are revealed.  If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more 
complicated than the service itself.  Just try it.

. . . . .

You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products 
there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. 
Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, 
and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the 
usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress.  Check 
us out, you'll be glad you did.

. . . . .

06. XP TIME FEATURE.  Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore 
required a separate software application.  It will connect, either at a 
programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset 
that often erroneous internal clock.  Just click on the time in the systems 
tray, go to   and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.

07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT.  A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn 
will begin here in the U.S.  For those who like to follow the display, 
consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection 
of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.

08. SAVINGS SCRAPS.  Some oldies are worth repeating.  If you're working 
with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way 
to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and 
click/drag it to your desktop.  When the newly created icon is clicked on, 
it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with 
the first few words of the text.  A double click opens the text in the 
application with which it was created.

09. QUICK ACCESS.    go to a frequently used program, you may find 
yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut 
icon.  Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide 
quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and 
select Properties.  In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can 
remember and click OK.  Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application 
whenever needed.

10.  DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL.  We've been asked about those emails with 
virus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a 
confirmation of a subscription.  Don't believe it, and don't open the 
attachments.  Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager) 
will clear things up:

NNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus 
that implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged 
subscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at 
all)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a 
widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will 
all around.  Is there some configuration that we could change to keep 
these from going out except to legitimate subscribers?

Lyris:  Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it 
isn't actually ListManager doing the sending.  The real problem is that 
people sometimes will add the ""join"" address to their address book and 
that is what causes the problems.  The best we can do is advise people not 
to have their address books set to automatically add any email address 
that they send a message to even once.  The main culprit here seems to be 
Outlook Express.

WHAT'S COMING NEXT WEEK:  Another batch of Neat Net Tricks in the Premium 
issue, including:

*  A great collection of information and free downloads to make your system 
more secure.

*  Free software to measure and display your real-time Internet speed.

*  Can you handle still another popup stopper - that's interference free - 
and at no cost?

*  An easy-to-use tool to store and arrange all your passwords, user IDs, 
and other info.

*  A Microsoft Word tip to easily work around that pesky autocompletion 
feature.

*  A whole arsenal of tools to combat spam.

*  Software that provides more than 200 interesting facts about your 
computer and displays about your CPU, memory, operating system, and your 
computer's power source.

*  Our in-depth article discusses how to best manage our important 
passwords and get out of trouble when we -inevitably - forget those passwords.

And more!  If you haven't subscribed yet, you won't find a better source of 
useful information for just 42 cents per issue.  That's $10 for a year's 
worth - 24 issues - at the NNT Store, http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store .

1,None,None,1,0,345,0,com,0,0,0,8,1,1,0,1,"Re: kernel BUG at filemap.c:843!: 1.0

I did more testing with your patch on top of today's CVS, but the patch
didn't help at all.
The following is the results of the tests:

Testing setup:
1. created a ""/dev/md0"" with 4 scsi disks
2. created a LVM Volume group ""vg"" with the ""/dev/md0""
3. created a LVM logical volume ""vol1"" with ""vg""
4. created a XFS fs with a command:
    mkfs.xfs -f -d sunit=8,swidth=8 /dev/vg/vol1
    -----------meta-data=/dev/vg/vol1           isize=256    agcount=8,
agsize=32767 blks
    -----------data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=262136,
imaxpct=25
    -----------         =                       sunit=1      swidth=1 blks,
unwritten=0
    -----------naming   =version 2              bsize=4096
    -----------log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=1200,
version=1
    -----------         =                       sunit=1 blks
    -----------realtime =none                   extsz=65536  blocks=0,
rtextents=0

Test results:
1. mount with quota enabled => occasional kernel oops, attached the file
oops1
2. mount without quota enabled => occasional kernel oops, attached the file
oops2
3. mount without quota enabled, while md device is in degraded mode =>
always kernel oops, attached the file oops3

Thanks,

JLee

Microsoft unbundles directory technology
Microsoft will begin selling its directory technology as a standalone product separate from the Windows operating system.
Microsoft will continue to build in its ""Active Directory"" as part of Windows, but will give its customers the new option of buying the technology as a separate product next year, Microsoft executives said this week. The directory technology essentially provides a network manager with a central database to store and manage information about users, computer systems and networking devices. Microsoft competes against Novell and Sun Microsystems in the directory-server software market.

Pittman set to leave AOL Time Warner
AOL Time Warner is expected to announce after the stock markets close Thursday that embattled chief operating officer Robert Pittman will relinquish his role as the media behemoth's No. 2 executive, according to a source close to the company.
Pittman, who also serves as the interim chief exective of the company's America Online unit, could remain at the online division until a permanent CEO is found. But the timetable for Pittman's departure will be based on his own decision, the source added. AOL Time Warner last week confirmed that it hired executive search firm Spencer Stuart to head AOL's CEO search.

Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. 
Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. 
Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting 
in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that 
the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's 
real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the 
address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes 
Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was 
the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal 
address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is
now available in all six formats
,  
for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content 
based on a couple reader suggestions.
Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never 
been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the
SIC
, I 
started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks. 
Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the 
employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show 
based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the
incriminating evidence
to prove it.
The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple 
titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented 
titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next 
several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in 
St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few 
more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who 
sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way, 
aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software 
titles with reg codes.

http://www.nvidia.com/
If you're in San Antonio July 23-25, for this year's Siggraph conference, 
you'll want to stop by the nVidia booth (#19102). Every 30 minutes 10 
people will be competing for a NVIDIA Quadro4 750 XGL professional 
graphics solution, using NVIDIA-provided traditional art materials such 
as charcoal, pastels, crayons and paper to create something artistic. 
All artwork must be original, unpublished work. Artwork must also
incorporate the NVIDIA logo and be created on-site at SIGGRAPH during the
10-minute contest round. Judging will be based on artistry; creativity and
originality; technical merit; and theme incorporation. Artwork will not be
returned to contestants and will become the property of NVIDIA as outlined
in the contest registration form. Even if you don't win, you'll still get a free t-shirt.

DreamQuest Championship Card Games
For Pocket PC, Palm, Symbian OS
http://www.dq.com/palm.html
Playing games on a PDA has killed plenty of my time spent waiting in 
airports around the US. With the recent porting of these three classic 
PC card games from DreamQuest, I've added some of the best in PC 
entertainment to my arsenal of PDA diversions. Hearts, Spades and Euchre 
all play in a similar manner to their PC versions, only on a smaller 
screen. Available for Pocket PC, Palm, and even the Symbian OS, you can 
play cards against computer opponents or connect to the online game room 
and challenge other players using any of the games multiple platforms. 
This is a unique experience currently unavailable for any other pocket games.

Rexway
http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/56/rexway.html
Blending punk rock attitude with country twang makes for a fairly 
unique musical experience. I saw these guys play a show in Omaha, 
back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage 
presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to 
kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the 
audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining 
evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics 
and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two. 
 ol fans should check out the countrified version of the classic 
HWAP; it's kind of like a cover tune, only more unique. If you 
are offended by 4-letter words, this band isn't for you.

Croupier
(NR) 1998
Drama - 94min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)
Special DVD Features worth a look-Deleted scenes
In disembodied first person Clockwork style narration,  Croupier
pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
games. Gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known,
however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
(casino dealer).  Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
are sorry sods; the croupier is king.
  father to son, the lesson
passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego ""Jake"" to
bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre.

Well, it's been half a week since we released it, and we're still
getting record downloads for our first
FREE Gnometome
. What does
that mean? Simple. Download all you want - we'll definitely make
more. In fact, we've found a way to get your products and services
a little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. And who
couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless your
data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you
get featured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls
to its knees. We're still
sitting
at #5 on Amazon
. If we ever
hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And, mind you, this hat has been sitting
around for quite a while; it smells like feet. You'd have to eat
three sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you'd get
from my hat. You're better off just going for the free stuff, I
suppose. The next time they ask: ""Do you care to Super Size that?""
You can respond, with dignity: ""My funds are sufficient for the
upgrade; I avoided spending money on something that would have
lasted longer, supported a helpful cause, and not have killed me
earlier."" It makes sense - if you think about it. The fries aren't
going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the fries, who will?
Put your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph
I like to call: ""Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL."" They
went out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this
evening. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""How kind of them,
Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's
issue. They must have read your mind!"" No, they must have rented a
list of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop
there. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER
marketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty
eye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish)
businesses in the future. It's my ""direct"" way of saying: you're
not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience?
I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people
from around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more
junk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me,
either. See what you get when you tempt fate?
My good buddy,
Bill
,
tells me that
Speakeasy.net
provides great DSL connections. He'll even get the credit if I
sign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him,
too: ""Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they
encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When
looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home
Services' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k
upstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that
is less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start
looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!"" And Stuart Portner is
chock full of common sense: ""Remember that a lot of DSL providers
give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at
least for initial setup / shakedown period."" All the more fries
for me, dude!
See You in

{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the
best thing to do with your money is to invest and then ""forget

likes to play the stock market. He's always logging into E*TRADE
and checking on his stocks. That's a lot of work! We told him to
forget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This Excel
spreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the
data into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, ""E*TRADE
doesn't give me half the information that Company Overview does,
such as insider trades and financial trends, along with many other
tidbits of information."" NOTE: You must use Excel 2000 or higher
for the spreadsheet to operate correctly.
Flexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/
{Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day,
and sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless
copies and shortcuts - and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I
don't need a reminder that there are five shortcuts or six copies
of something on my desktop... and that is where Flexible Renamer
comes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the
""Shortcut to"" and ""Copy of"" prefixes from all my files, making
them a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even
make a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.
If you don't like your
filename in all caps, then just switch them
to lower case and vice-versa. The possibilities are endless! (You
know, I always wanted to change my own name from ""Chris"" to
""Caspian Wildflowers""...)

{Restore deleted files} Have you ever deleted a file from your PC,
realizing later that you actually needed it? Yeah, me too. Best-

deleted file. But what if I had already emptied the Recycle Bin?
(Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save
the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files
or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to
wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up
Disk Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100%
certainty)!

Actual Title Buttons 1.3 [1.0M] W9x/2k/XP $19.95
Unearthed by Michael Tretyakov
http://www.actualtools.com/
{Windows Explorer add-on} ""Actual Title Buttons lets you add the
new Minimize   Tray and Stay On  p buttons to any program's
title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close
buttons."" This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the
distractions of other windows popping up over your active windows.
While writing this review, I am using the ""Stay On  p"" command
for Notepad, and during this time I have already received five
instant messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages
would pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with
Actual Title Buttons, I can keep typing without missing those
""important"" instant messages. The only difference is that they
aren't an annoyance now. The ""Minimize   Tray"" feature is great,
too, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing...
especially when you don't have to close down your programs to do
it.

{Icons for your machine} Gretchen and I are really looking forward
to moving to our new neighborhood in a little over a month.
Everything is better with a little dash of friendliness, right?
Icons are no exception. All the action on this website is based
around a city block of Electriconland. You walk into different
stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and
you will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be
disappointed when you go around the corner and pick up your
Avengers icons from the comic store. If all this wasn't good
enough then maybe this fact alone will send you to the street of
Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This means you
can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux
machine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities
are endless!

GnomeTIP
I just hate it when I try to install a program and the
installation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't
leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say
I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows
Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for
any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging
through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \
Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Installer. Add a new String
value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:
""voicewarmup"" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any
order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =
Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error

add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an

I just have to check in the ""Temp"" directory and look for my log

Question: which group is 250,000+ strong and always looking for stuff to make their personal and professional lives run smoother?
HAPPY FUN STUFF
And now, we see how Sprocket thinks he has a right to eat pumpkin seeds. Or, would that be ""pupkin"" seeds?

I'm now twice a published author. Earlier in the week, I released my
top 50 Mac OS X tips
, 
which marks the only thing I've ever written that I 
expect anyone to pay for. If you happen to use OS X, go check them out. 
My second publication is a PDF only explanation of the process for 
converting Vinyl LPs to CD, by way of your PC (how's that for alphabet 
soup). For the time being, you can get it absolutely free, with the 
caveat that I'd appreciate some feed back on what could be added to make 
it more useful (I'm considering some screen shots for it if I get some 
time). What are you waiting for --
get something free already
.
With the expiration of Lockergnome's old cell phone plan, Lori and I 
opted to make a switch to Verizon, at the recommendation of Brian 
Stevens. I'm already happy with the suggestion, as our previous provider 
had horrid customer service, not to mention I now have a much geekier 
phone in the form of the
Kyocera QCP 6035
Palm powered unit. It's just 
larger than most Palm devices on the market, but having the device 
integration is nice. It has all the functionality of a Palm, with some 
Internet browsing capabilities and of course, phone access. A built in 
speakerphone actually works better than I expected,  Now all I need to 
do is get more applications installed.
Of interest to anyone who signed up for
emusic
after Chris and I talked 
the service up and down last week: It seems they've added in the ballpark 
of 1,000 Universal titles to their roster of offerings. Not surprising 
considering they're part of the same conglomerate, but still good news 
in terms of feature expansion.

GIF Movie Gear v3.02 [1129k] W9X/NT/W2K/XP $40
http://www.moviegear.com/gmgdet.htm
The majority of GIF animation on the Web does absolutely nothing for 
me. I'm of the mindset that animation is meant to either tell a story 
or illustrate a concept -- not put something in motion just because 
you can. That said, for anyone wanting to create animations, this tool 
makes it nice and easy. A storyboard interface keeps you thinking like 
a movie maker as you build your animated creations, which lends itself 
to helping anyone who'd like to get from point A to point B in an 
orderly fashion. The software supports PSD, JPG, AVI, BMP, and GIF 
formats, leaving your options open for creating animated segments.

Madshrimps Extreme CDROM Testing
http://www.madshrimps.com/index-e.php?action=webnews-e&l1=0&l2=30
A little on the childish side, but this CD-Rom drive test is still very funny. 
Watch as this group rewrites the rules on drive benchmarking. If geek TV were 
more like this, even non-geeks would tune in to watch (which probably says 
more than it should about the lowest common denominator). A WMV capable player 
is required,.

Tapeheads
(R) 1988
Comedy - 93min
Reviewer's Tilt (2)
Two out of work rent-a-cops make an attempt to break into the music 
video industry in this quirky comedy. John Cusack and Tim Robbins 
make this comedy work, starring as the two security guards as they 
send up all sorts of Hollywood stereotypes. You can't help but laugh 
at the ridiculous predicaments these two survive, as they are 
greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and movie industry names. 
I'm sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list this movie on a 
resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them, 
especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each 
other. Although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's 
underground classics I hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant 
to those out there who are looking to put it to the man. If you've 
ever hated the recording industry and its in-crowd attitude, you'll 
love this film. A closing reference to Rene's Courtyard Cafe in Santa 
Monica, which is a regular stop for me every time I'm in the LA area, 
prompted me to want to watch the film for a second viewing. The movie 
is humorous enough for several viewings. Nothing really grabs attention 
on the DVD, but then again, the studio probably expects no one will buy 
it anyway.

    ZDNET DELIVERS Price-Feature Analysis	Vol 1, No. 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This week, we present a special shopper report featuring
four cool products. We have reviewed these products,
compared each to five products with similar features,
and analyzed the range of prices for each category. What
you'll see is a shopper tool we've dubbed the ""Price-Feature
Ratio Analysis."" Featured products can fall in to three
stages of Price-Feature ratios:

Stage 1: High Price-Feature Ratio - Technophiles will rush
to buy the product, but can expect to pay higher prices
for the honor of being the first among their friends to have one.

Stage 2: Variable Price-Feature Ratio - Expect high variability
in prices among products with similar features. It pays to
comparison shop for the best price.

Stage 3: Low Price-Feature Ratio - When compared to products
with similar features, prices are low and don't vary much
from merchant to merchant. Use our merchant ratings to
find the right one for you.

We have rated each of the products featured in this supplement
to aid your shopping experience.

CNET Reviews
Dear readers,
The majority of PC users may run Windows, but Microsoft can't
touch the passion that Mac users bring to computing. This week,
Apple devotees gathered in New York to find out what their guru,
Steve Jobs, has in store for them. They were not disappointed,
with offerings ranging from the new iMacs, which continue to push
the boundaries of the PC form factor, to updated iPods that
include more memory, better menus, and compatibility with
Windows. Read the
full coverage

CNET's News.com.

PIMs on the side
Whatever happened to the straightforward, dedicated PIM?
   PIM/contact managers, such as the ubiquitous Outlook and
   Lotus, pushed them to the sidelines. But a few PIMs survived
   this enforced obscurity. If you need a plain PIM that doesn't
   cost a fortune, one of these may tickle your fancy.

Readers mourn Gene Kan
Peer-to-peer pioneer dies, Macworld kicks off in Manhattan, and
the PayPal/eBay merger is not going so well.
--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends
1
Gene Kan
:
Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June
   29 in an apparent suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET
   community. Last week, search requests for information on
   25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
   products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the
   peer-to-peer space, many credit him with legitimizing file
   sharing--making it about more than music, according to Wired
   News.
2
Macworld
:
The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a
   good show, whether or not Steve Jobs has anything real to
   announce. So far, it looks like Apple has already surprised a
   few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No. 7),
   which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing
   quagmire.
3
PayPal
:
It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and
   PayPal deal. Soon after eBay announced it was buying PayPal
   for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit claiming that
   PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being
   subpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its
   involvement with online gambling transactions.
4
Wi-Fi
:
I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up
   on the Buzz Meter permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting
   interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights,
   including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Communications, to
   build wireless access places across the nation in public areas
   where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as
   airports.
5
eMac
:
This is the for-education-only computer that consumers
   wanted so badly that Apple released it to them. The CNET
   review is out, and here's the word: the eMac is what the iMac
   used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly inexpensive
   computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
   processing and accessing the Web.

Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda
happened with
yesterday's
tip
. I forgot to mention that the String value's label
is ""Logging"" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger,
eh? The oversight was totally my fault. I've been thinking about
asking Gretchen and Brian to help with future reviews. Don't be
surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure you'd welcome a female
perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our landlords
pick a paint color for the ""office"" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the
Internet? You betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and
rugs. I have a feeling I'll be the one tweaking furniture layout.
Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet. I wonder if Ikea has an
affiliate program?
I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.""
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away.
I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask?"" It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks.
See You in
August

Directory Lister v0.5.2 [547k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://freeware.prv.pl/
{List directory contents} When I was younger, I'd get so frustrated at those games where you'd have to pick out all of the subtle differences between two pictures. I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.
Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREE
http://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm
{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an ""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""...

SQLView v2.1.0.20 [5.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREE

{View ODBC Output} SQLView is ""A SQL Database viewing utility. (It) automatically detects all available ODBC data sources and displays them in an explorer-like tree. User(s) may double-click on data sources to access the databases, browse tables, execute custom queries and export (the) data to .CSV or .XML files."" I didn't really have much on my machine to throw at this program. However, the one data source I did have (mostly related to Music CD creation) displayed perfectly in SQL View.

CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20
Unearthed by Shawn Verrall
http://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp
{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is. Dude, where's my car?

GnomeTIP
I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

* ALERT UPDATE: Urge Your Representative to Co-Sponsor the DMCRA!

As the legislative season ends, it is vitally important to gather
support for legislation that will be center-stage in the next session.
This is an opportunity to ask your representative to take a stand for
your rights. Ask her/him to co-sponsor the DMCRA today!

Representatives Rick Boucher and John Doolittle recently introduced
the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA, H.R. 5544), which
would require labelling on usage-impaired ""copy-protected"" compact
discs and would make several several amendments to 1998's infamous
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

* ALERT: Bait and Switch; Anticounterfeiting Bill Hurts Your Rights!

Don't be fooled by Senator Biden's ""Anticounterfeiting Amendments of
2002"" (S. 2395, also known as ""the Biden Bill""). It started as an
attempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and
counterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to
include digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky
power-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in
copyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It
goes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could:

~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the
exceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could
prohibit the use of interface information essential for software
interoperability and competition

~ Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could
also require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to
reconfigure their products.

~ Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by
the Copyright Act for identical behavior

This ""anticounterfeiting"" bill is a decoy; stand up for your rights
today! Subscribe to the EFF Action Center and send your member of
Congress an email, letter or fax. You can take action by going to:

* Canadian Trademark Law Overreaching

EFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching
trademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a
Canadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal
information website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem
especially egregious.

Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been
published since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued
by Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.
Quicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name
LAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website
under that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of
the Quicklaw.com website that offers public ""teasers"" in the form of
summaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available
through the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian
lawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially
different, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed
computer service and the other for information freely available on the
public internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more
problematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the
term LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed
requests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark
authorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a
Canadian trademark issued for ""lawsnet.""

Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia
through over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a
court order requiring her to undergo an extensive ""discovery"" process
that threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free
legal assistance in the past, this next phase will require
significantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can
muster. Quicklaw is represented by a large  ronto firm, Borden Ladner
and Gervais, LLP.

Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even
been granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is
unfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,
and its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and
useful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark
is causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant
ownership in words, especially descriptive words like ""laws"" and ""net""
when describing an online legal information service. Trademark law
should also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal
information (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop
individuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free
legal information to the public.

For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local  ronto lawyer and
part-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a
legal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,
please contact:

THE BUZZ ABOUT THE UPCOMING MOVIE

People are already talking about the sensitive subject of kids and drug addiction featured in ""The Secret Life of Zoey.""
Lifetimetv.com community member BELFAST BELLE writes:
""My belief is that I started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me. My mom died when I was 10. I had to live away from my dad and brothers. Where I grew up I was sexually abused for years, but I didn't dare tell anyone. When I finally went to live with my dad and brothers, I had no self-esteem left. I experienced so much shame, and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened. Drugs helped me to feel OK and like I was a part of something. When my dad died, I was devastated. It threw me into a full-blown addiction. My drug use landed me in rehab, in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers. Thanks to the help of Narcotics Anonymous, I have been clean since December 28, 1991. I now have great relationships with my siblings. I love them more than they will ever know. I also have a beautiful seven-year-old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs. I don't have any desire to use, either -- just the desire to be the best pe
 rson I can be.""

Microsoft stresses security for Exchange
Microsoft is readying a new Exchange Server e-mail system, with improved security, a facelift for Outlook, and better support for cell phones and other handhelds. The upcoming version, the company's first major update of the product since releasing Exchange 2000 nearly two years ago, will by default
disable certain messaging features
to prevent hackers and virus makers from taking advantage of openings. While Microsoft's biggest nemesis in the e-mail and messaging market is
Lotus
, the company also competes against
Novell
and newcomer
Oracle
, which plans to release its own e-mail and messaging software later this year.

IBM puts more bite in 'Shark'
Can IBM's release of a new top-end ""Shark""
enterprise storage system
boost the company's prospects in the depressed storage market? Big Blue has fixed many early Shark problems, improving everything from data transfer capabilities to cache size, and adding
RAID 10 support
and Eliza self-healing features. But IBM faces the still dominant
EMC
, which last week lured away Mark Lewis from HP to become its new CTO; and
Hitachi
, which  still boasts the technology edge. IBM's edge is its ability to bundle Shark sales with related server and service deals.

Frethem worm variant:  ""Re: Your password!""
An e-mail message that promises to reveal
secret information
with a password is a variant from the pesky Frethem worm family. Frethem.k (aka w32.frethem.k@mm) is a more robust version of Frethem.e, which uses its own SMTP engine to send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. Mac and Linux users are not affected.

An improved CLIE
With the CLIE PEG-T665C, Sony took everything good about the PEG-T615C--including its terrific color screen and solid design--and added a faster processor and MP3 support to make quite an

. But with Pocket PCs now selling for less than this CLIE and a whole new Palm OS on the horizon, is this the right time to invest in the T665C?

The Freedom Rides
By Denis Mueller

At the end of World War II, the United States was a rigidly 
segregated country but there were cracks beginning to show. 
In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that ruled that segregated 
seating on interstate transportation was illegal. In 1947, 
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge 
the racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders 
were jailed often ending up on chain gangs.

By 1961, the time was right to challenge America's Jim Crow 
laws and CORE proposed the ""Freedom Rides."" CORE felt that 
they could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby 
creating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to 
intervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE 
members knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE 
director James Farmer maintained they were ready.  ""When we 
began the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much 
violence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the 
possibility of death.""

On May 4th, 1961 they set out to New Orleans. In the upper 
south they met no resistance but by the time they got to 
Alabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who 
slashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was 
worse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well 
aware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were 
the Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, 
and when they arrived they were severely beaten. 

Despite the warnings there were no police to protect them. 
Governor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. 
So the terrorist attacks went on. The ""Freedom Riders"" were 
determined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-
ville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested 
and sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and 
immediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the 
journey.

Meanwhile, their plight became international news and 
""Freedom Riders"" left Birmingham on May 20th determined to 
continue. State officials had promised Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached 
Montgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, 
the riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, 
bravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. 
He still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-
deniable. Others including Justice Department official John 
Seigenthaler were also beaten.

The situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-
vention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-
ing martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off 
period but the riders refused. They would continue on. So 
they set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a 
deal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be 
protected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had 
caved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General 
and the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising 
their constitutional rights. They never finished their trip 
but their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and 
in the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be 
defeated. It is another example of how people change things, 
not government officials.

Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,
As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday
Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.
Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.
Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.
For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works.
I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on
CNET Radio
every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.
Sincerely,
David Coursey
